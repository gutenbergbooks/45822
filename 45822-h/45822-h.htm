<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE GRAND MASTER OF THE SECRET SOCIETY.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">On</span> the left bank of the Rhine, near the spot where the Selz
rivulet springs forth, the foothill ranges rise of many mountains,
of which the bristling humps seem to rush northerly
like herds of frightened buffaloes, disappearing in the haze.
These mountains tower over a deserted region, forming a
guard around one more lofty than the rest, whose granite
brow, crowned with a ruined monastery, defies the skies. It is
Thunder Mount.</p>

<p>On the sixth of May, 1770, as the great river wavelets were
dyed in the rainbow hues of the setting sun, a man who had
ridden from Maintz, after a journey through Poland, followed
the path out of Danenfels Village until it ended, and, then,
alighting and leading his steed, tied it up in the pine woods.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, my good <i>Djerid</i> (javelin)," said the horseman
to the animal with this Arabian name which bespoke its blood,
and its speed; "and good-bye, if we never meet again."</p>

<p>He cast a glance round him as if he suspected he were overheard.</p>

<p>The barb neighed and pawed with one foot.</p>

<p>"Right, Djerid, the danger is around us."</p>

<p>But as if he had made up his mind not to struggle with it, the
venturesome stranger drew the charges from a pair of splendid
pistols and cast the powder and bullets on the sward before
replacing them in the holsters. He wore a steel-hilted
sword which he took off with the belt, and fastened it to the
stirrup leather so as to hang from the saddle-horn point down.</p>

<p>These odd formalities being done, he ungloved, and searching
his pockets produced nail-scissors and pocket-knife, which
he flung over his shoulder without looking to see whither
they went.</p>

<p>Drawing the longest possible breath, he plunged at random
into the thicket, for there was no trace of a path.</p>

<p>He was a man about thirty, taller than the average, but so
wonderfully well built that the utmost strength and skill<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>
seemed to circulate in his supple and nervy limbs. He wore
a black velvet overcoat with gilt buttons; the flaps of an
embroidered waistcoat showed below its lowest buttons, and
the buckskin riding breeches defined legs worthy to be a sculptor's
models; the elegant feet were cased in patent leather
boots.</p>

<p>His countenance was a notable mixture of power and intelligence,
with all the play of Southern races; his glance,
able to display any emotion, seemed to pierce any one on
whom it fell with beams that sounded the very soul. His
cheeks had been browned by a sun hotter than that of France.
His mouth was large but finely shaped, and parted to reveal
magnificent teeth, all the whiter from his dark complexion.
His hand was small but muscular; his foot long but fine.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he taken a dozen steps within the glade before
he heard faint footsteps. He rose on tiptoe and perceived that
unseen hands had unhitched Djerid and were leading him
away. He frowned slightly, and a faint smile curled his full
cheeks and choicely chiseled lips.</p>

<p>He continued into the heart of the forest.</p>

<p>For a space the twilight guided him, but soon that died out,
and he stood in gloom so dense that he had to stop lest he
blundered blindly.</p>

<p>"I reached Danenfels from Maintz," he said, aloud, "as
there was a road. I reached this forest as there was a path: I
am here as there was some light: but I must stop now as I
have no sight."</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken, in a dialect part French, part <a name="tn_png_6"></a><!--TN: "Sicil ian" changed to "Sicilian" on Page 4-->Sicilian,
than a light flashed out only fifty paces off.</p>

<p>"Thanks! I will follow the light as long as it leads."</p>

<p>The light at once moved onward, regularly and steadily,
like a stage lamp managed by the lime-light operator.</p>

<p>At a hundred paces, a breath in the adventurer's ear made
him wince.</p>

<p>"Turn and you die!" came this whisper.</p>

<p>"All right," answered the stranger.</p>

<p>"Speak, and you die!" whispered a voice on the left-hand.</p>

<p>He bowed without speaking.</p>

<p>"But," said a voice seeming to issue from the bowels of the
earth, "if you are afraid, go back to the plain, by which it
will be clear that you are daunted, and renounce your errand."</p>

<p>The traveler waved his hand to imply that he was going
ahead, and ahead he went.</p>

<p>But it was so late and the shade so deep that he stumbled
during the hour the magic light preceded him, but he did not
murmur or show any tremor in fear, while he heard not a
breath.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, the light went out!</p>

<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>

<p>He had passed through the woodland, for on lifting his
eyes, he could see a few stars glitter on the darksome sky.</p>

<p>He kept on in the same direction till he saw loom up the
somber mass of the ruins of a castle&mdash;its spectre. At the
same time his foot met its fallen stones.</p>

<p>A clammy thing wound itself round his forehead and
sealed his eyes. He could no longer see even the shadows.
It was a wet linen cloth. It must have been an expected
thing, for he made no resistance to being blindfolded. But
he put forth his hand silently as a blinded man naturally does
to grope. The gesture was understood, for on the instant a
cold, dry, bony hand clutched his fingers. He knew it was
a skeleton's, but had it possessed feeling, it must have owned
that his own hand no more trembled.</p>

<p>For a hundred yards the seeker was dragged forward rapidly.</p>

<p>All at once the bandage was plucked aloof, and he stopped;
he had reached the top of the Thunder Mount.</p>

<p>Before him rose the moldy, mossy steps of the portico of
the old Castle of Donnerberg. On the first slab stood the
phantom with the osseous hand which had guided him thither.
From head to foot a long shroud enwrapped it; through a slit
the dead eyes peered without luster. The fleshless hand
pointed into the ruins where the goal seemed to be a hall too
high up to be viewed, but with the collapsed ceiling flickering
with a fickle light.</p>

<p>The traveler nodded in consent. Slowly the ghost mounted
the steps one by one, till amid the ruins. The man followed
with the same solemn and tranquil pace regulating his
walk, and he also entered.</p>

<p>Behind him slammed the principal door as noisily as a ringing
bronze gate.</p>

<p>The phantom guide had paused on the threshold of a round
hall hung with black and illumined with greenish hues of
three lamps.</p>

<p>"Open your eyes," said the ghastly guide.</p>

<p>"I see," replied the other, stopping ten paces from him.</p>

<p>Drawing a double-edged sword from his shroud with a
swift and haughty gesture, the phantom smote with it a
brazen column which boomed a note like a gong.</p>

<p>Immediately, all around, the slabs of the hall floor rose up,
and countless ghosts like the guide, stole in with drawn swords
and took posts on steps where they stood like statues on their
pedestals, cold and motionless. They stood out against the
sable drapery.</p>

<p>Higher than the steps was a dais for seven chairs; on these
six ghosts took place, leaving one seat vacant; they were
chiefs.</p>

<p>"What is our number, brothers?" challenged one of the
six rising in the middle.</p>

<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>

<p>"Three hundred is the right tally," answered the spectres,
with one voice thundering through the hall and dying amid
the black hangings.</p>

<p>"Three hundred," said the presiding chief, "representing
each ten thousand associates; three hundred swords worth
three millions of daggers. What do you want, stranger?" he
demanded, turning to the intruder.</p>

<p>"To see the Light," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"The paths leading to the Mountain of Fire are hard and
toilsome&mdash;fear you not to tread them?"</p>

<p>"I fear nothing."</p>

<p>"You can not turn back once you start. Bear this in
mind."</p>

<p>"I mean to stop only at the goal."</p>

<p>"Are you ready to take the oath?"</p>

<p>"Say it and I will repeat."</p>

<p>The president lifted his hand and slowly and solemnly
uttered these words:</p>

<p>"In the name of the Master Carpenter, swear to break all
carnal bonds tying you to whomsoever, and above all to those
to whom you may have pledged faith, obedience or service."</p>

<p>The new-comer in a firm voice repeated what was pronounced.</p>

<p>"From this out," continued the president, "you are
absolved from plights made to native land and rulers. Swear
to reveal to your new leader what you have seen and done,
heard or learned, read or guessed, and further to spy and discover
all passing under your eyes."</p>

<p>On his ceasing the novice repeated.</p>

<p>"Honor and respect the Water of Death," went on the president
without a change of voice, "as a prompt means in skilled
hands, sure and needful, to purge the globe by the death or
insanity of those who strive to stifle the Truth or snatch it
from our hands."</p>

<p>An echo could not more faithfully repeat the vow.</p>

<p>"Avoid Spain, Naples, and all accursed lands; and moreover
the temptation to let out what you learn and hear&mdash;for the
lightning is less swift to strike than we with our unseen but
inevitable blade, wheresoever you may flee. Now, live in the
name of the Supernal Three!"</p>

<p>In spite of the final threat, no emotion could be descried on
the novice's face, as he reiterated the words with as calm a
tone as he used at the outset.</p>

<p>"Now, deck the applicant with the sacred ribbon," said the
president.</p>

<p>Two shrouded figures placed on the bent brow of the stranger
a sky-blue ribbon with silver letters and female figures;
the ends of the badge were tied behind on the nape. They
stepped aside, leaving him alone again.</p>

<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the chief officer.</p>

<p>"Three things: the iron hand to strangle tyranny; the
fiery sword to drive the impure from earth; and the diamond
scales to weigh the destinies of mankind."</p>

<p>"Are you prepared for the tests?"</p>

<p>"Who seeks to be accepted, should be ready for everything."</p>

<p>"The tests!" shouted the ghosts.</p>

<p>"Turn round," said the president.</p>

<p>The stranger faced a man, pale as death, bound and
gagged.</p>

<p>"Behold a traitor who revealed the secrets of the Order
after taking such an oath as you did. Thus guilty, what
think you he deserves?"</p>

<p>"Death."</p>

<p>"Death!" cried the three hundred sword-bearers.</p>

<p>Instantly the unhappy culprit, despite superhuman resistance,
was dragged to the back of the hall. The initiated one
saw him wrestling and writhing in the torturers' hands and
heard his voice hissing past the gag. A poniard flashed in the
lamplight like lightning, and after it fell, with a slapping
sound of the hilt, the dead body landed heavily on the
stone floor.</p>

<p>"Justice has been executed," observed the stranger, turning
round to the terrifying circle, whose greedy eyes had
gazed on him out of their grave clothes.</p>

<p>"So you approve of the execution?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if the slain were truly guilty."</p>

<p>"And would you drink the downfall of any one who sold
the secrets of this Ancient Association?"</p>

<p>"In any beverage."</p>

<p>"Bring hither the cup," said the arch-officer.</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_9"></a><!--TN: Quote removed before "One" on Page 7-->One of the two executioners drew near with a skull brimming
with a warm and ruddy liquid. The stranger took the
goblet by its brass stem and said, as he held it up: "I drink
to the death of all false brothers." Lowering the cup to his
lips, he drained it to the last drop, and calmly returned it to
the giver.</p>

<p>A murmur of astonishment ran around the assemblage, as
the phantoms glanced at one another.</p>

<p>"So far well. The pistol," said the chief.</p>

<p>A ghost stole up to the speaker holding a pistol in one hand,
and powder and ball in the other, without the novice seeming
to deign a glance in that direction.</p>

<p>"Do you promise passive obedience to the brotherhood,
even though it were to recoil on yourself?"</p>

<p>"Whoso enters the household of the Faithful is no longer
his own property."</p>

<p>"Hence you will obey any order given you?"</p>

<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>

<p>"Straightway."</p>

<p>"Take this firearm and load it."</p>

<p>"What am I to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Cock it."</p>

<p>The stranger set the hammer, and the click of it going on
full cock was plainly heard in the deep stillness.</p>

<p>"Clap the muzzle to your temple," ordered the president,
and the suppliant obeyed without hesitating.</p>

<p>The silence deepened over all; the lamps seemed to fade, and
the bystanders had no more breath than ghosts.</p>

<p>"Fire!" exclaimed the president.</p>

<p>The hammer fell and the flint emitted sparks in the pan;
but it was only the powder there which took fire and no report
followed its ephemeral flame.</p>

<p>An outcry of admiration burst from nearly every breast,
and the president instinctively held out his hand toward the
novice.</p>

<p>But two tests were not enough for some doubters who
called out: "The dagger!"</p>

<p>"Since you require it, bring the dagger," said the presiding
officer.</p>

<p>"It is useless," interrupted the stranger, shaking his head
disdainfully.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked several voices.</p>

<p>"Useless," repeated the new-comer, in a voice rising above
all the others, "for you are wasting precious time. I know
all your secrets, and these childish proofs are unworthy the
head of sensible beings. That man was not murdered; the
stuff I drank was wine hid in a pouch on his chest; the bullet
and powder I loaded the trick-pistol with fell into a hollow in
the stock when the weapon was cocked. Take back the sham
arm, only good to frighten cowards. Rise, you lying corpse;
you cannot frighten the <a name="tn_png_10"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "strong-minded." on Page 8-->strong-minded."</p>

<p>A terrible roar shook the hall.</p>

<p>"To know our mysteries, you must be an initiate or a spy,"
said the president.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded three hundred voices together,
as a score of swords shone in the grip of the nearest and were
lowered by the regular movement of trained soldiers toward
the intruder's bosom.</p>

<p>Calm and smiling, he lifted his head, wound round with the
sacred fillet, and replied:</p>

<p>"I am the Man for the Time."</p>

<p>Before his lordly gaze the blades lowered unevenly as they
on whom it fell obeyed promptly or tried to resist the influence.</p>

<p>"You have made a rash speech," said the president, "but it
may have been spoken without your knowing its gravity."</p>

<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>

<p>"I have replied as I was bound," said the other, shaking his
head and smiling.</p>

<p>"Whence come you, then?" questioned the chief.</p>

<p>"From the quarter whence cometh the Light," was the response.</p>

<p>"That is the East, and we are informed that you come from
Sweden."</p>

<p>"I may have passed through there from the Orient," said
the stranger.</p>

<p>"Still we know you not. A second time, who are you?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you in a while, since you pretend not to know
me; but, meantime, I will tell you who you are."</p>

<p>The spectres shuddered and their swords clanked as they
shifted them from the left to the right hands again to point
them at his breast.</p>

<p>"To begin with you," said the stranger, pointing to the
chief, "one who fancies himself a god and is but a forerunner&mdash;the
representative of the Swedish Circles&mdash;I will name you,
though I need not name the others. Swedenborg, have not
the angels, who speak familiarly with you, revealed that the
Man you expect was on the way?"</p>

<p>"True, they told me so," answered the principal, parting his
shroud the better to look out.</p>

<p>This act, against the rule and habit during the rites, displayed
the venerable countenance and snowy beard of an old
man of eighty.</p>

<p>"And on your left," continued the stranger, "sits the representative
of Great Britain, the chief of the Scottish Rites. I
salute your lordship. If the blood of your forefathers runs in
your veins, England may hope not to have the Light die out."</p>

<p>The swords dropped, for anger was yielding to surprise.</p>

<p>"So this is you, captain?" went on the stranger to the last
leader on the president's left; "in what port have you left
your handsome cruiser, which you love like a lass. The
<i>Providence</i> is a gallant frigate, and the name brings good
luck to America."</p>

<p>"Now for your turn, Prophet of Zurich," he said to the
man on the right of the chief. "Look me in the face, since
you have carried the science of Physiognomy to divination,
and tell me if you do not read my mission in the lines of my
face?"</p>

<p>The person addressed recoiled a step.</p>

<p>"As for you, descendant of Pelagius, for a second time the
Moors must be driven out of Spain. It would be an easy
matter if the Castilians have not lost the sword of the Cid."</p>

<p>Mute and motionless dwelt the fifth chief: the voice seemed
to have turned him to stone.</p>

<p>"Have you nothing to say to me?" inquired the sixth delegate,
anticipating the denouncer who seemed to forget him.</p>

<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>

<p>"Yea, to you I have to say what the Son of the Great
Architect said to Judas, and I will speak it in a while."</p>

<p>So replied the traveler, fastening on him one of those
glances which pierced to the heart.</p>

<p>The hearer <a name="tn_png_12"></a><!--TN: "become" changed to "became" on Page 10-->became whiter than his shroud, while a murmur
ran round the gathering, wishful to call the accused one to
account.</p>

<p>"You forget the delegate of France," observed the
chief.</p>

<p>"He is not among you&mdash;as you well know, for there is his
vacant place," haughtily made answer the stranger. "Bear
in mind that such tricks make them smile who can see in the
dark; who act in spite of the elements, and live though Death
menaces them."</p>

<p>"You are a young man to speak thus with the authority of
a divinity," resumed the principal. "Reflect, yourself&mdash;impudence
only stuns the ignorant or the irresolute."</p>

<p>"You are all irresolute," retorted the stranger, with a smile
of supreme scorn, "or you would have acted against me. You
are ignorant, since you do not know me, while I know ye all.
With boldness alone I succeed against you, but boldness
would be vain against one with irresistible power."</p>

<p>"Inform us with a proof of this power," said the Swedenborg.</p>

<p>"What brings ye together?"</p>

<p>"The Supreme Council."</p>

<p>"Not without intention," went on the visitant, "have you
come from all quarters, to gather in the sanctuary of the Terrible
Faith."</p>

<p>"Surely not," replied the Swede; "we come to hail the person
who has founded a mystic empire in the Orient, uniting
the two hemispheres in a commonalty of beliefs, and joining
the hands of human brotherhood."</p>

<p>"Would you know him by any token?"</p>

<p>"Heaven has been good enough to unveil it by the intermediation
of its angels," answered the visionary.</p>

<p>"If you hold this secret alone and have not revealed it to a
soul, tell it aloud, for the time has come."</p>

<p>"On his breast," said the chief of the Illuminati, "he wears
a diamond star, in the core of which shines the three initials of
a phrase known to him alone."</p>

<p>"State those initials."</p>

<p>"L. P. D."</p>

<p>With a rapid stroke the stranger opened his overcoat, coat
and waistcoat and showed on the fine linen front, gleaming
like flame, a jeweled plate on which flared the three letters
in rubies.</p>

<p>"HE!" ejaculated the Swede: "can this be he?"</p>

<p>"Whom all await?" added the other leaders, anxiously.</p>

<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>

<p>"The Hierophant of Memphis&mdash;the Grand Copt?" muttered
the three hundred voices.</p>

<p>"Will you deny me now?" demanded the Man from the
East, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"No," cried the phantoms, bowing to the ground.</p>

<p>"Speak, Master," said the president and the five chiefs, bowing,
"and we obey."</p>

<p>The visitor seemed to reflect during the silence, some instants
long.</p>

<p>"Brothers," he finally said, "you may lay aside your
swords uselessly fatiguing your arms, and lend me an attentive
ear, for you will learn much in the few words I address you.
The source of great rivers is generally unknown, like most
divine things: I know whither I go, but not my origin.
When I first opened my eyes to consciousness, I was in the
sacred city of Medina, playing about the gardens of the Mufti
Suleyman. I loved this venerable old man like a father, but
he was none of mine, and he addressed me with respect
though he held me in affection. Three times a day he stood
aside to let another old man come to me whose name I ever
utter with gratitude mixed with awe. This august receptacle
of all human wisdom, instructed in all things by the Seven
Superior Spirits, bore the name of Althotas. He was my tutor
and master, and venerable friend, for he is twice the age of the
oldest here."</p>

<p>Long shivers of anxiety hailed this speech, spoken in
solemnity, with majestic gesticulation and in a voice severe
while smooth.</p>

<p>"One day in my fifteenth year, in the midst of my studies,
my old master came to me with a phial in hand. 'Acharat,'
he said&mdash;it was my name&mdash;'I have always told you that
nothing is born to die forever in this world. Man only lacks
clearness of mind to be immortal. I have found the beverage to
scatter the clouds, and next will discover that to dispel death.
Yesterday I drank of this distillation: I want you to drink
the rest to-day.'</p>

<p>"I had extreme trust in my teacher but my hand trembled
in taking this phial, like Eve's in taking the apple of
Life.</p>

<p>"'Drink,' he said, smiling. And I drank.</p>

<p>"'Sleep,' he said, laying his hands on my head. And I
slept.</p>

<p>"Then all that was material about me faded away, and the
soul that solitarily remained lived again, like Pythagoras,
for centuries through which it had passed. In the panorama
unfolded before it, I beheld myself in previous existence, and,
awaking, comprehended that I was more than man."</p>

<p>He spoke with so strong a conviction, and his eyes were
fixed heavenward with so sublime an expression that a mur<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>mur
of admiration hailed him: astonishment had yielded to
wonder, as wrath had to astonishment.</p>

<p>"Thereupon," continued the Enlightened One, "I determined
to devote my existence at present, as well as the fruit
of all my previous ones, to the welfare of mankind. Next
day, as though he divined my plan, Althotas came to me and
said:</p>

<p>"'My son, your mother died twenty years ago as she gave
birth to you; for twenty years your sire has kept hidden by
some invincible obstacle; we will resume our travels and if
we meet him, you may embrace him&mdash;but not knowing him.'
You see that all was to be mysterious about me, as with all the
Elect of heaven.</p>

<p>"At the end of our journeys, I was a Theosophist. The
many cities had not roused my wonderment. Nothing was
new to me under the sun. I had been in every place formerly
in one or more of my several existences. The only thing
striking me was the changes in the peoples. Following the
March of Progress, I saw that all were proceeding toward
Freedom. All the prophets had been sent to prop the tottering
steps of mankind, which, though blind at birth, staggers
step by step toward Light. Each century is an age for the
people. Now you understand that I come not from the Orient
to practice simply the Masonic rites, but to say: Brothers, we
must give light to the world. France is chosen to be the torch-bearer.
It may consume, but it will be a wholesome conflagration,
for it will enlighten the world. That is why France has
no delegate here; he may have shrunk from his duty. We
want one who will recoil from nothing&mdash;and so I shall go
into France. It is the most important post, the most perilous,
and I undertake it."</p>

<p>"Yet you know what goes on there?" questioned the president.</p>

<p>Smiling, the man called Acharat replied: "I ought to know,
for I have been preparing matters. The king is old, timid,
corrupt, but less antiquated and hopeless of cure than the monarchy
he represents. Only a few years further will he sit on
the throne. We must have the future laid out from when he
dies. France is the keystone of the arch. Let that stone be
wrenched forth by the six millions of hands which will be
raised at a sign from the Inner Circle, and down will fall the
monarchical system. On the day when there shall be no
longer a king in France, the most insolently enthroned ruler
in Europe will turn giddy, and spring of his own accord into
the gulf left by the disappearance of the throne of Saint Louis."</p>

<p>"Forgive the doubt, most venerated Master," interrupted
the chief on the right, with the Swiss accent, "but have you
taken all into calculation?"</p>

<p>"Everything," replied the Grand Copt, laconically.</p>

<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>

<p>"In my studies, master, I was convinced of one truth&mdash;that
the characteristics of a man were written on their faces. Now,
I fear that the French people will love the new rulers of the
country you speak of&mdash;the sweet, clement king, and the lovely
amiable queen. The bride of the Prince Royal, Marie Antoinette,
is even now crossing the border. The altar and the
nuptial bed are being made ready at Versailles. Is this the
moment to begin your reformation?"</p>

<p>"Most illustrious brother," said the supreme chief to the
Prophet of Zurich, "if you read the faces of man, I read the
features of the future. Marie Antoinette is proud and will
obstinately continue the conflict, in which she will fall beneath
our attacks. The Dauphin, Louis Auguste, is good and mild;
he will weaken in the strife and perish like his wife, and with
her. But each will fall and perish by the opposite virtue and
fault. They esteem each other now&mdash;we will not give them
time to love one another, and in a year they will entertain
mutual contempt. Besides, brothers, why should we debate
on the point whence cometh the light, since it is shown to me?
I come from out of the East, like the shepherds guided by the
star, announcing a new birth of man. To-morrow, I set to
work, and with your help I ask but twenty years to kill not a
mere king but a principle. You may think twenty years long
to efface the idea of royalty from the hearts of those who
would sacrifice their children's lives for the little King Louis
XV. You believe it an easy matter to make odious the lilyflowers,
emblem of the Bourbon line, but it would take you
ages to do it.</p>

<p>"You are scattered and tremble in your ignorance of one
another's aspirations. I am the master-ring which links you all
in one grand fraternal tie. I tell you that the principles
which now you mutter at the fireside; scribble in the shadows
of your old towers; confide to one another under the rose and
the dagger for the traitor or the imprudent friend who utters
them louder than you dare&mdash;these principles may be shouted
on the housetops in broad day, printed throughout Europe
and disseminated by peaceful messengers, or on the points of
the bayonets of five hundred soldiers of Liberty, whose colors
will have them inscribed on their folds. You tremble at the
name of Newgate Prison; at that of the Inquisition's dungeon;
or of the Bastile, which I go to flout at&mdash;hark ye! We shall
all laugh pity for ourselves on that day when we shall trample
on the ruins of the jails, while our wives and children dance
for joy. This can come to pass only after the death of monarchy
as well as of the king, after religious powers are scorned,
after social inferiority is completely forgotten, and after the
extinction of aristocratic castes and the division of noblemen's
property. I ask for a generation to destroy an old world and<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
rear a new one, twenty seconds in Eternity, and you think it
is too much!"</p>

<p>A long greeting in admiration and assent hailed the somber
prophet's speech. It was clear that he had won all the sympathy
of the mysterious mandatories of European intellect.
Enjoying his victory just a space, the Grand Copt resumed:</p>

<p>"Let us see now, brothers, since I am going to beard the
lion in his den, what you will do for the cause for which you
pledged life, liberty and fortune? I come to learn this."</p>

<p>Silence, dreadful from its solemnity, followed these words.
The immobile phantoms were absorbed in the thoughts which
were to overthrow a score of thrones. The six chiefs conferred
with the groups and returned to the president to consult
with him before he was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I stand for Sweden," he said. "I offer in her name the
miners who raised the Vasas to the throne&mdash;now to upset it,
together with a hundred thousand silver crown pieces."</p>

<p>Drawing out tablets, the Hierophant wrote this offer. On
the president's left spoke another:</p>

<p>"I am sent by the lodges of England and Scotland. I can
promise nothing for the former country, which is burning to
fight us Scots. But in the name of poor Erin and poor Scotia,
I promise three thousand men, and three thousand crowns
yearly."</p>

<p>"I," said the third speaker, whose vigor and rough activity
was betrayed beneath the winding sheet fettering such a <a name="tn_png_16"></a><!--TN: Comman changed to a period added after "form" on Page 14-->form.
"I represent America, where every stick and stone, tree and
running brook, and drop of blood belong to rebellion. As
long as we have gold in our hills, we will send it ye; as long
as blood to shed, we will risk it; but we cannot act till we
ourselves are out of the yoke. We are so divided as to be
broken strands of a cable. Let a mighty hand unite but two
of the strands, and the rest will twist up with them into a
hawser to pull down the crowned evils from their pride of
place. Begin with us, most venerable master. If you want
the French to be delivered from royalty, make us free of
British domination."</p>

<p>"Well spoken," said the Hierophant of Memphis. "You
Americans shall be free, and France will lend a helping hand.
In all languages, the Grand Architect hath said: 'Help each
other!' Wait a while. You will not have long to bide, my
brother."</p>

<p>Turning to the Switzer, he drew these words from him:</p>

<p>"I can promise only my private contribution. The sons of
our republic have long supplied troops to the French monarchy.
They are faithful bargainers, and will carry out their
contracts. For the first time, most venerated Master, I am
ashamed of their loyalty."</p>

<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>

<p>"Be it so, we must win without them and in their teeth.
Speak, Spain!"</p>

<p>"I am poor," said the grandee, "and have but three thousand
brothers to supply. But each will furnish a thousand
<i>reals</i> a year. Spain is an indolent land, where man would
doze though a bed of thorns."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said the Grand Master. "Speak, you, brother."</p>

<p>"I speak for Russia and the Polish clubs. Our brothers
are discontented rich men, or serfs doomed to restless labor
and untimely death. In the name of the latter, owning nothing,
not even life, I can promise nothing; but three thousand
rich men will pay twenty louis a head every year."</p>

<p>The other deputies came forward by turns, and had their
offers set down in the Copt's memorandum book as they
bound themselves to fulfill their plight.</p>

<p>"The word of command," said the leader, "already spread
in one part of the world, is to be dispensed through the others.
It is symbolized by the three letters which you have seen.
Let each one wear them in the heart as well as on it, for we,
the Sovereign Master of the shrines of the Orient and the
West, we order the ruin of the Lilies. L. P. D. signifies
<i>Lilia Pedibus Destrue</i>&mdash;Trample Lilies Under! I order you
of Spain, Sweden, Scotland, Switzerland and America, to
Trample down the Lilies of the Bourbon race."</p>

<p>The cheering was like the roar of the sea, under the vault,
escaping by gusts down the mountain gorges.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Architect, begone," said the Master.
"By stream and strand and valley, begone by the rising of
the sun. You will see me once more, and that will be on the
day of triumph. Go!"</p>

<p>He terminated his address with a masonic sign which was
understood solely by the six chiefs, who remained after the
inferiors had departed. Then the Grand Copt took the Swede
aside.</p>

<p>"Swedenborg, you are really an inspired man, and heaven
thanks you by my voice. Send the cash into France to the
address I shall give you."</p>

<p>The president bowed humbly, and went away amazed by
the second sight which had unveiled his name.</p>

<p>"Brave Fairfax," said the Master to another, "I hail you
as the worthy son of your sire. Remind me to General Washington
when next you write to him."</p>

<p>Fairfax retired on the heels of Swedenborg.</p>

<p>"Paul Jones," went on the Copt to the American deputy,
"you have spoken to the mark, as I expected of you. You
will be one of the heroes of the American Republic. Be both
of you ready when the signal is flying."</p>

<p>Quivering as though inspired by a holy breath, the future
capturer of the <i>Serapis</i> likewise retired.</p>

<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>

<p>"Lavater," said the Master to the Swiss, "drop your theories
for it is high time to take up practice; no longer study what
man is, but what he may become. Go, and woe to your fellow
countrymen who take up arms against us, for the wrath of
the people is swift and devouring even as that of the God on
high!"</p>

<p>Trembling, the physiognomist bowed and went his way.</p>

<p>"List to me, Ximenes," said the Copt to the Spaniard;
"you are zealous, but you distrust yourself. You say, Spain
dozes. That is because no one rouses her. Go and awake her;
Castile is still the land of the Cid."</p>

<p>The last chief was skulking forward when the head of the
Masons checked him with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>"Schieffort, of Russia, you are a traitor who will betray our
cause before the month is over; but before the month is out,
you will be dead."</p>

<p>The Muscovite envoy fell on his knees; but the other made
him rise with a threatening gesture, and the doomed one reeled
out of the hall.</p>

<p>Left by himself in the deserted and silent hall, the strange
man buttoned up his overcoat, settled his hat on his head,
pushed the spring of the bronze door to make it open, and
went forth. He strode down the mountain defiles as if they
had long been known to him, and without light or guide in
the woods, went to the further edge. He listened, and hearing
a distant neigh, he proceeded thither. Whistling peculiarly,
he brought his faithful Djerid to his hand. He leaped
lightly into the saddle, and the two, darting away headlong,
were enwrapped in the fogs rising between Danenfels and the
top of the Thunder Mountain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE LIVING-WAGON IN THE STORM.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">A week</span> after the events depicted, a living-wagon drawn by
four horses and conducted by two postboys, left Pont-a-Mousson,
a pretty town between Nancy and Metz. Nothing
like this caravan, as show people style the kind, had ever
crossed the bridge, though the good folks see theatrical carts
of queer aspect.</p>

<p>The body was large and painted blue, with a baron's
insignia, surmounting a J. and a B., artistically interlaced.
This box was lighted by two windows, curtained with muslin,
but they were in the front, where a sort of driver's cab hid
them from the vulgar eye. By these apertures the inmate of
the coach could talk with outsiders. Ventilation was given
this case by a glazed skylight in the "dickey," or hind box of
the vehicle, where grooms usually sit. Another orifice completed
the oddity of the affair by presenting a stovepipe, which<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>
belched smoke, to fade away in the wake as the whole rushed
on.</p>

<p>In our times one would have simply imagined that it
was a steam conveyance and applauded the mechanician who
had done away with horses.</p>

<p>The machine was followed by a led horse of Arab extraction,
ready saddled, indicating that one of the passengers sometimes
gave himself the pleasure and change of riding alongside the
vehicle.</p>

<p>At St. Mihiel the mountain ascent was reached. Forced to
go at a walk, the quarter of a league took half an hour.</p>

<p>Toward evening the weather turned from mild and clear to
tempestuous. A cloud spread over the skies with frightful
rapidity and intercepted the setting sunbeams. All of a sudden
the cloud was stripped by a lightning flash, and the startled
eye could plunge into the immensity of the firmament, blazing
like the infernal regions. The vehicle was on the mountain
side when a second clap of thunder flung the rain out of
the cloud; after falling in large drops, it poured hard.</p>

<p>The postboys pulled up. "Hello!" demanded a man's
voice from inside the conveyance, "what are you stopping
for?"</p>

<p>"We are asking one another if we ought to go on," answered
one postillion with the deference to a master who had
paid handsomely.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I ought to be asked about that. Go
ahead!"</p>

<p>But the rain had already made the road downward slippery.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, the horses won't go," said the elder postillion.</p>

<p>"What have you got spurs for?"</p>

<p>"They might be plunged rowels deep without making
the balky creatures budge; may heaven exterminate
me if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The blasphemy was not finished, as a dreadful lightning
stroke cut him short. The coach was started and ran upon
the horses, which had to race to save themselves from being
crushed. The equipage flew down the sloping road like an
arrow, skimming the precipice.</p>

<p>Instead of the traveler's voice coming from the vehicle, it
was his head.</p>

<p>"You clumsy fellows will kill us all!" he said. "Bear to
the left, deuce take ye!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Joseph," screamed a woman's voice inside, "help!
Holy Madonna, help us!"</p>

<p>It was time to invoke the Queen of Heaven, for the heavy
carriage was skirting the abysm; one wheel seemed to be in
the air and a horse was nearly over when the traveler, springing
out on the pole, grasped the postboy nearest by the collar
and slack of the breeches. He raised him out of his boots as<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>
if he were a child, flung him a dozen feet clear, and taking
his place in the saddle, gathered up the reins, and said in a
terrifying voice to the second rider:</p>

<p>"Keep to the left, rascal, or I shall blow out your brains!"</p>

<p>The order had a magical effect. The foremost rider, haunted
by the shriek of his luckless comrade, followed the substitute
impulse and bore the horses toward the firm land.</p>

<p>"Gallop!" shouted the traveler. "If you falter, I shall
run right over you and your horses."</p>

<p>The chariot seemed an infernal machine drawn by nightmares
and pursued by a whirlwind.</p>

<p>But they had eluded one danger only to fall into another.</p>

<p>As they reached the foot of the declivity, the cloud split
with an awful roar in which was blended the flame and the
thunder.</p>

<p>A fire enwrapped the leaders, and the wheelers and the
leaders were brought to their haunches as if the ground gave
way under them. But the fore pair, rising quickly and feeling
that the traces had snapped, carried away their man in the
darkness. The vehicle, rolling on a few paces, stopped on the
dead body of the stricken horse.</p>

<p>The whole event had been accompanied by the screams of
the woman.</p>

<p>For a moment of confusion, none knew who was living or
dead.</p>

<p>The traveler was safe and sound, on feeling himself; but
the lady had swooned. Although he guessed this was the
case, it was elsewhere that he ran to aid&mdash;to the rear of the
vehicle.</p>

<p>The led horse was rearing with bristling mane, and shaking
the door, to the handle of which his halter was hitched.</p>

<p>"Hang the confounded beast again!" muttered a broken
voice within; "a curse on him for shaking the wall of my
laboratory." Becoming louder, the same voice added in Arabic:
"I bid you keep quiet, devil!"</p>

<p>"Do not wax angry with Djerid, master," said the traveler,
untying the steed and fastening it to the hind wheel; "he is
frightened, and for sound reasons."</p>

<p>So saying, he opened a door, let down the steps, and stepped
inside the vehicle, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>He faced a very aged man, with hooked nose, gray eyes,
and shaking yet active hands. Sunken in a huge armchair,
he was following the lines of a manuscript book on vellum,
entitled "The Secret Key to the Cabinet of Magic," while holding
a silver skimmer in his other hand.</p>

<p>The three walls&mdash;for this old man had called the sides of
the living-wagon "walls"&mdash;held bookcases, with shelves of
bottles, jars and brass-bound boxes, set in wooden cases like
utensils on shipboard so as to stand up without upsetting. The<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
old man could reach these articles by rolling the easy chair to
them; a crank enabled him to screw up the seat to the level of
the highest. The compartment was, in feet, eight by six and
six in height. Facing the door was a furnace with hood and
bellows. It was now boiling a crucible at a white heat, whence
issued the smoke by the pipe overhead exciting the mystery of
the villagers wherever the wagon went through.</p>

<p>The whole emitted an odor which in a less grotesque laboratory
would have been called a perfume.</p>

<p>The occupant seemed to be in bad humor, for he grumbled:</p>

<p>"The cursed animal is frightened: but what has he got to
disturb him, I want to know? He has shaken my door,
cracked my furnace, and spilt a quarter of my elixir in the
fire. Acharat, in heaven's name, drop the beast in the first
desert we cross."</p>

<p>"In the first place, master," returned the other smiling,
"we are not crossing deserts, for we are in France; and next,
I would not abandon a horse worth a thousand louis, or rather
priceless, as he is of the breed of Al Borach."</p>

<p>"I will give you a thousand over and over again. He has
lost me more than a million, to say nothing of the days he
has robbed me of. The liquor would have boiled up without
loss of a drop, in a little longer, which neither Zoroaster nor
Paracelsus stated, but it is positively advised by Borri."</p>

<p>"Never mind, it will soon be boiling again."</p>

<p>"But that is not all&mdash;something is dropping down my
chimney."</p>

<p>"Merely water&mdash;it is raining."</p>

<p>"Water? Then my elixir is spoilt. I must renew the work&mdash;as
if I had any time to spare!"</p>

<p>"It is pure water from above. It was pouring, as you
might have noticed."</p>

<p>"Do I notice anything when busy? On my poor soul,
Acharat, this is exasperating. For six months I have been
begging for a cowl to my chimney&mdash;I mean this year. You
never think of it, though you are young and have lots of
leisure. What will your negligence bring about? The rain
to-day or the wind to-morrow confound my calculations and
ruin all my operations. Yet I must hurry, by Jove! for my
hundredth year commences on the fifteenth of July, at eleven
at night precisely, and if my elixir of life is not then ready,
good-night to the Sage Althotas."</p>

<p>"But you are getting on well with it, my dear master, I
think."</p>

<p>"Yes, by my tests by absorption, I have restored vitality to
my paralyzed arm. I only want the plant mentioned by
Pliny, which we have perhaps passed a hundred times or crushed
under the wheels. By the way, what rumbling is that? Are
we still going?"</p>

<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>

<p>"No; that is thunder. The lightning has been playing the
mischief with us, but I was safe enough, being clothed in
silk."</p>

<p>"Lightning? Pooh! wait till I renew my life and can attend
to other matters. I will put a steel bridle on your electric
fluid and make it light this study and cook my meals. I wish
I were as sure of making my elixir perfect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And our great work&mdash;how comes it on?"</p>

<p>"Making diamonds? That is done. Look there in the glass
dish."</p>

<p>Joseph Balsamo greedily caught up the crystal saucer, and
saw a small brilliant amid some dust.</p>

<p>"Small, and with flaws," he said, disappointed.</p>

<p>"Because the fire was put out, Acharat, from there being
no cowl to the chimney."</p>

<p>"You shall have it; but do take some food."</p>

<p>"I took some elixir a couple of hours ago."</p>

<p>"Nay, that was at six this morning, and it is now the <a name="tn_png_22"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "afternoon." on Page 20-->afternoon."</p>

<p>"Another day gone, fled and lost," moaned the alchemist,
wringing his hands; "are they not growing shorter? Have
they less than four-and-twenty hours?"</p>

<p>"If you will not eat, at least take a nap."</p>

<p>"When I sleep, I am afraid I shall never wake. If I lie
down for two hours, you will come and call me, Acharat,"
said the old man in a coaxing <a name="tn_png_22a"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "voice." on Page 20-->voice.</p>

<p>"I swear I will, master."</p>

<p>At this point they heard the gallop of a horse and a scream
of astonishment and disquiet.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" questioned the traveler, quickly
opening the door, and leaping out on the road without using
the steps.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE LOVELY LORENZA.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> woman who was in the fore part of the coach, in the
cab, remained for a time deprived of sense. As fear alone
had caused the swoon, she came to consciousness.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" she cried, "am I abandoned helpless here,
with no human being to take pity upon me?"</p>

<p>"Lady," said a timid voice at hand, "I am here, and I may
be some help to you."</p>

<p>Passing her head and both arms out of the cab by the
leather curtains, the young woman, rising, faced a youth who
stood on the steps.</p>

<p>"Is it you offered me help? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"The thunderbolt nearly struck you, and the traces were<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>
broken of the leading pair, which have run off with the postboy."</p>

<p>"What has become of the person who was riding the other
pair?" she asked, with an anxious look round.</p>

<p>"He got off the horses as if all right and went inside the
other part of this coach."</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised," said she, breathing more freely.
"But who are you to offer me assistance so timely?"</p>

<p>"Surprised by the storm, I was in that dark hole which is
a quarry outlet, when I suddenly saw a large wagon coming
down at a gallop. I thought it a runaway, but soon saw it
was guided by a mighty hand, but the lightning fell with
such an uproar that I feared I was struck and was stunned.
All seemed to have happened in a dream."</p>

<p>The lady nodded as if this satisfied her, but rested her head
on her hand in deep thought. He had time to examine her.
She was in her twenty-third year, and of dark complexion,
but richly colored with the loveliest pink. Her blue eyes
sparkled like stars as she appealed to heaven, and her hair
fell in curls of jet, unpowdered contrary to the fashion, on
her opal neck.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" she suddenly inquired.</p>

<p>"On the Strasburg to Paris highway, near Pierrefittes, a
village. Bar-le-Duc is the next town, with some five thousand
population."</p>

<p>"Is there a short cut to it?"</p>

<p>"None I ever heard of."</p>

<p>"What a pity!" she said in Italian.</p>

<p>As she kept silent toward him, the youth was going away,
when this drew her from her reverie, for she called him for
another question.</p>

<p>"Is there a horse still attached to the coach?"</p>

<p>"The gentleman who entered, tied it to the wheel."</p>

<p>"It is a valuable animal, and I should like to be sure it is
unhurt; but how can I go through this mud?"</p>

<p>"I can bring it here," proposed the stripling.</p>

<p>"Do so, I prithee, and I shall be most grateful to you."</p>

<p>But the barb reared and neighed when he went up.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," said the lady: "it is gentle as a lamb.
Djerid," she called in a low voice.</p>

<p>The steed recognized the mistress's voice, for it extended its
intelligent head toward the speaker, while the youth unfastened
it. But it was scarcely loose before it jerked the reins
away and bounded up to the vehicle. The woman came forth,
and almost as quickly leaped on the saddle, with the dexterity
of those sylphs in German ballads who cling to riders while
seated on the crupper. The youth sprang toward her but she
stopped him with an imperative wave of the hand.</p>

<p>"List to me. Though but a boy, or because you are young,<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>
you have humane feelings. Do not oppose my flight. I am
fleeing from a man I love, but I am above all a good Catholic.
This man would destroy my soul were I to stay by him, as he
is a magician whom God sent a warning to by the lighting.
May he profit by it! Tell him this, and bless you for the help
given me. Farewell!"</p>

<p>Light as the marsh mist, she was carried away by the
gallop of Djerid. On seeing this, the youth could not restrain
a cry of surprise, which was the one heard inside the coach.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">GILBERT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> alarmed traveler closed the coach door behind him carefully,
and looked wistfully round. First he saw the young
man, frightened. A flash of lighting enabled him to examine
him from head to foot, an operation habitual to him on seeing
any new person or thing. This was a springald of sixteen,
small, thin and agile; his bold black eyes lacked sweetness
but not charm: shrewdness and observation were revealed in
his thin, hooked nose, fine lip and projecting cheek bones,
while the rounded chin stuck out in token of resolution.</p>

<p>"Was that you screamed just now,&mdash;what for?" queried the
gentleman.</p>

<p>"The lady from the cab there rode off on the led horse."</p>

<p>The traveler did not make any remark at this hesitating
reply; not a word; he rushed to the fore part and saw by the
lightning that it was empty.</p>

<p>"Sblood!" he roared in Italian, almost like the thunder peal
accompanying the oath.</p>

<p>He looked round for means of pursuit, but one of the coach-horses
in chase of Djerid would be a tortoise after a gazelle.</p>

<p>"Still I can find out where she is," he muttered, "unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Quickly and anxiously he drew a small book from his vest
pocket, and in a folded paper found a tress of raven hair.</p>

<p>His features became serene, and apparently he was
calmed.</p>

<p>"All is well," he said, wiping his streaming face. "Did she
say nothing when she started?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that she quitted you not through hate but fear, as she
is a Christian, while you&mdash;you are an atheist, and miscreant,
to whom God sought to give a final warning by this storm."</p>

<p>"If that is all, let us drop the subject."</p>

<p>The last traces of disquiet and discontent fled the man's
brow. The youth noticed all this with curiosity mingled
with keen observation.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my young friend?" inquired the
traveler.</p>

<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>

<p>"Gilbert."</p>

<p>"Your <a name="tn_png_25"></a><!--TN: "Christain" change to "Christian" on Page 23-->Christian name, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is my whole name."</p>

<p>"My dear Gilbert, Providence placed you on my road to
save me from bother. I know your youth compels you to be
obliging: but I am not going to ask anything hard of you&mdash;only
a night's lodging."</p>

<p>"This rock was my shelter."</p>

<p>"I should like a dwelling better where I could get a good
meal and bed."</p>

<p>"We are a league and a half from Pierrefitte, the next village."</p>

<p>"With only two horses that would take two hours. Just
think if there is no refuge nearer."</p>

<p>"Taverney Castle is at hand, but it is not an inn."</p>

<p>"Not lived in?"</p>

<p>"Baron Taverney lives there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is he?"</p>

<p>"Father of Mademoiselle Andrea de Taverney&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Delighted to hear it," smilingly said the other: "but I
want to know the kind of man he is."</p>

<p>"An old nobleman who used to be wealthy."</p>

<p>"An old story. My friend, please take me to Baron Taverney's."</p>

<p>"He does not receive company," said the youth, in apprehension.</p>

<p>"Not welcome a stray gentleman? He must be a bear."</p>

<p>"Much like it. I do not advise your risking it."</p>

<p>"Pooh! The bear will not eat me up alive."</p>

<p>"But he may keep the door closed."</p>

<p>"I will break it in; and unless you refuse to be my guide&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not; I will show the way."</p>

<p>The traveler took off the carriage lamp, which Gilbert held
curiously in his hands.</p>

<p>"It has no light," he said.</p>

<p>"I have fire in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Pretty hard to get fire from flint and steel this weather,"
observed the youth.</p>

<p>But the other drew a silver case from his pocket, and opening
the lid plunged a match into it; a flame sprang up and he
drew out the match aflame. This was so sudden and unexpected
by the youth, who only knew of tinder and the spark,
and not of phosphorus, the toy of science at this period, that
he started. He watched the magician restore the case to his
pocket with greed. He would have given much to have the
instrument.</p>

<p>He went on before with the lighted lamp, while his companion
forced the horses to come by his hand on the bridle.</p>

<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>

<p>"You appear to know all about this Baron of Taverney,
my lad!" he began the dialogue.</p>

<p>"I have lived on his estate since a child."</p>

<p>"Oh, your kinsman, tutor, master?"</p>

<p>At this word the youth's cheek colored up, though usually
pale, and he quivered.</p>

<p>"I am no man's servant, sir," he retorted. "I am son of
one who was a farmer for the baron, and my mother nursed
Mademoiselle Andrea."</p>

<p>"I understand; you belong to the household as foster-brother
of the young lady&mdash;I suppose she is young?"</p>

<p>"She is sixteen."</p>

<p>He had answered only one of the two questions, and not
the one personal to him.</p>

<p>"How did you chance to be on the road in such weather?"
inquired the other, making the same reflection as our own.</p>

<p>"I was not on the road, but in the cave, reading a book
called 'The Social Contract,' by one Rousseau."</p>

<p>"Oh, found the book in the lord's library?" asked the <a name="tn_png_26"></a><!--TN: "gentlemen" changed to "gentleman" on Page 24-->gentleman
with some astonishment.</p>

<p>"No, I bought it of a peddler who, like others of his trade,
has been hawking good books hereabouts."</p>

<p>"Who told you 'The Contract' was a good book?"</p>

<p>"I found that out by reading it, in comparison with some
infamous ones in the baron's library."</p>

<p>"The baron gets indecent books, always costly, in this hole?"</p>

<p>"He does not spend money on them as they are sent him
from Paris by his friend the Marshal Duke of Richelieu."</p>

<p>"Oh! of course he does not let his daughter see such stuff?"</p>

<p>"He leaves them about, but Mademoiselle Andrea does not
read them," rejoined the youth, drily.</p>

<p>The mocking traveler was briefly silent. He was interested
in this singular character, in whom was blended good and
evil, shame and boldness.</p>

<p>"How came you to read bad books?"</p>

<p>"I did not know what they were until read; but I kept on
as they taught me what I was unaware of. But 'The Contract'
told me what I had guessed, that all men are brothers,
society badly arranged, and that instead of being serfs and
slaves, individuals are equal."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the gentleman, as they went on. "You
seem to be hungry to learn?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is my greatest wish to know everything, so as to
rise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what station?"</p>

<p>Gilbert paused, for having a goal in his mind, he wanted to
keep it hidden.</p>

<p>"As far as man may go," he answered.</p>

<p>"So you have studied?"</p>

<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>

<p>"How study when I was not rich and was cooped up in
Taverney? I can read and write; but I shall learn the rest
somehow one of these days."</p>

<p>"An odd boy," thought the stranger.</p>

<p>During the quarter of an hour they had trudged on, the
rain had ceased, and the earth sent up the sharp tang replacing
the sulphurous breath of the thunderstorms.</p>

<p>"Do you know what storms are?" questioned Gilbert, after
deep musing.</p>

<p>"Thunder and lightning are the result of a shock between
the electricity in the air and in the earth," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"I do not follow you," sighed Gilbert.</p>

<p>The traveler might have supplied a more lucid explanation
but a light glimmered through the trees.</p>

<p>"That is the carriage-gateway of Taverney," said the guide.</p>

<p>"Open it."</p>

<p>"Taverney gate does not open so easily as that."</p>

<p>"Is it a fort? Knock, and louder than that!"</p>

<p>Thus emboldened, the boy dropped the knocker and hung
on to the bell, which clanged so lustily that it might be heard
afar.</p>

<p>"That is Mahon barking," said the youth.</p>

<p>"Mahon? He names his watchdog after a victory of his
friend my Lord Richelieu, I see," remarked the traveler.</p>

<p>"I did not know that. You see how ignorant I am,"
sighed Gilbert.</p>

<p>These sighs summed up the disappointments and repressed
ambition of the youth.</p>

<p>"That is the goodman Labrie coming," said the latter at the
sound of footsteps within.</p>

<p>The door opened, but at the sight of the stranger the old
servant wanted to slam it.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, friend," interposed the traveler; "don't shut
the door in my face. I will risk my travel-stained garb, and I
warrant you that I shall not be expelled before I have warmed
myself and had a meal. <i>I</i> hear you keep good wine, eh?
You ought to know that?"</p>

<p>Labrie tried still to resist, but the other was determined and
led the horses right in with the coach, while Gilbert closed
the gates in a trice. Vanquished, the servant ran to announce
his own defeat. He rushed toward the house, shouting:</p>

<p>"Nicole Legay!"</p>

<p>"Nicole is Mademoiselle Andrea's maid," explained the boy,
as the gentleman advanced with his usual tranquility.</p>

<p>A light appeared among the shrubbery, showing a pretty
girl.</p>

<p>"What is all this riot; what's wanted of me?" she challenged.</p>

<p>"Quick, my lass," faltered the old domestic, "announce to<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
master that a stranger, overtaken by the storm, seeks hospitality
for the night."</p>

<p>Nicole darted so swiftly toward the building as to be lost instantly
to sight. Labrie took breath, as he might be sure that
his lord would not be taken by surprise.</p>

<p>"Announce Baron Joseph Balsamo," said the traveler;
"the similarity in rank will disarm your lord."</p>

<p>At the first step of the portal he looked round for Gilbert,
but he had disappeared.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">TAVERNEY AND HIS DAUGHTER.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Though</span> forewarned by Gilbert of Baron Taverney's poverty,
Baron Balsamo was not the less astonished by the meanness
of the dwelling which the youth had dubbed the Castle. On
the paltry threshold stood the master in a dressing gown and
holding a candle.</p>

<p>Taverney was a little, old gentleman of five-and-sixty, with
bright eye and high but retreating forehead. His wretched
wig had lost by burning at the candles what the rats had
spared of its curls. In his hands was held a dubiously white
napkin, which proved that he had been disturbed at table.
His spiteful face had a likeness to Voltaire's, and was divided
between politeness to the guest and distaste to being disturbed.
In the flickering light he looked ugly.</p>

<p>"Who was it pointed out my house as a shelter?" queried
the baron, holding up the light to spy the pilot to whom he
was eager to show his gratitude, of course.</p>

<p>"The youth bore the name of Gilbert, I believe."</p>

<p>"Ugh! I might have guessed that. I doubted, though, he
was good enough for that. Gilbert, the idler, the philosopher!"</p>

<p>This flow of epithets, emphasized threateningly, showed
the visitor that little sympathy existed between the lord and
his vassal.</p>

<p>"Be pleased to come in," said the baron, after a short
silence more expressive than his speech.</p>

<p>"Allow me to see to my coach, which contains valuable
property," returned the foreign nobleman.</p>

<p>"Labrie," said Lord Taverney, "put my lord's carriage
under the shed, where it will be less uncovered than in the
open yard, for some shingles stick to the roof. As for the
horses, that is different, for I cannot answer for their supper;
still, as they are not yours, but the post's, I daresay it makes no
odds."</p>

<p>"Believe me, I shall be ever grateful to your lordship&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do not deceive yourself," said the baron, holding up
the candle again to light Labrie executing the work with the<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>
aid of the foreign noble; "Taverney is a poor place and a sad
one."</p>

<p>When the vehicle was under cover, after a fashion, the guest
slipped a gold coin into the servant's hand. He thought it a
silver piece, and thanked heaven for the boon.</p>

<p>"Lord forbid I should think the ill of your house that you
speak," said Balsamo, returning and bowing as the baron began
leading him through a broad, damp antechamber, grumbling:</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, I know what I am talking about; my means
are limited. Were you French&mdash;though your accent is German,
in spite of your Italian title&mdash;but never mind&mdash;you
would be reminded of the rich Taverney."</p>

<p>"Philosophy," muttered Balsamo, for he had expected the
speaker would sigh.</p>

<p>The master opened the dining-room door.</p>

<p>"Labrie, serve us as if you were a hundred men in one. I
have no other lackey, and he is bad. But I cannot afford
another. This dolt has lived with me nigh twenty years without
taking a penny of wages, and he is worth it. You will
see he is stupid."</p>

<p>"Heartless," Balsamo continued his studies; "unless he is
putting it on."</p>

<p>The dining-room was the large main room of a farmhouse
which <a name="tn_png_29"></a><!--TN: "has" changed to "had" on Page 27-->had been converted into the manor. It was so plainly
furnished as to seem empty. A small, round table was placed
in the midst, on which reeked one dish, a stew of game and
cabbage. The wine was in a stone jar; the battered, worn
and tarnished plate was composed of three plates, a goblet and
a salt dish; the last, of great weight and exquisite work,
seemed a jewel of price amid the rubbish.</p>

<p>"Ah, you let your gaze linger on my salt dish?" said the
host. "You have good taste to admire it. You notice the
sole object presentable here. No, I have another gem, my
daughter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Andrea?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Taverney, astonished at the name being known;
"I shall present you. Come, Andrea, my child, and don't
be alarmed."</p>

<p>"I am not, father," said a sonorous but melodious voice as
a maiden appeared, who seemed a lovely pagan statue animated.</p>

<p>Though of the utmost plainness, her dress was so tasteful
and suitable that a complete outfit from a royal wardrobe
would have appeared less rich and elegant.</p>

<p>"You are right," he whispered to his host, "she is a precious
beauty."</p>

<p>"Do not pay my poor girl too many compliments," said the
old Frenchman carelessly, "for she comes from the nunnery<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>
school and may credit them. Not that I fear that she will be
a coquette," he continued; "just the other way, for the dear
girl does not think enough of herself, and I am a good father,
who tries to make her know that coquetry is a woman's first
power."</p>

<p>Andrea cast down her eyes and blushed; whatever her
endeavor she could not but overhear this singular theory.</p>

<p>"Was that told to the lady at convent, and is that a rule in
religious education?" queried the foreigner, laughing.</p>

<p>"My lord, I have my own ideas, as you may have noticed. I
do not imitate those fathers who bid a daughter play the
prude and be inflexible and obtuse; go mad about honor,
delicacy and disinterestedness. Fools! they are like seconds
who lead their champion into the lists with all the armor removed
and pit him against a man armed at all points. No,
my daughter Andrea will not be that sort, though reared in a
rural den at Taverney."</p>

<p>Though agreeing with the master about his place, the baron
deemed it duty to suggest a polite reproof.</p>

<p>"That is all very well, but I know Taverney; still, be that
as it may, and far though we are from the sunshine of
Versailles Palace, my daughter is going to enter the society
where I once flourished. She will enter with a complete
arsenal of weapons forged in my experience and recollections.
But I fear, my lord, that the convent has blunted them.
Just my luck! my daughter is the only pupil who took the
instructions as in earnest and is following the Gospel. Am I
not ill-fated?"</p>

<p>"The young lady is an angel," returned Balsamo, "and
really I am not surprised at what I hear."</p>

<p>Andrea nodded her thanks, and they sat down at table.</p>

<p>"Eat away, if hungry. That is a beastly mess which
Labrie has hashed up."</p>

<p>"Call you partridges so? You slander your feast. Game-birds
in May? Shot on your preserves?"</p>

<p>"Mine? My good father left me some, but I got rid of
them long ago. I have not a yard of land. That lazybones
Gilbert, only good for mooning about, stole a gun somewhere
and done a bit of poaching. He will go to jail for it, and a
good riddance. But Andrea likes game, and so far, I forgive
the boy."</p>

<p>Balsamo contemplated the lovely face without perceiving a
twinge, wrinkle or color, as she helped them to the dish,
cooked by Labrie, furnished by Gilbert, and maligned by the
baron.</p>

<p>"Are you admiring the salt dish again, baron?"</p>

<p>"No, the arm of your daughter."</p>

<p>"Capital! the reply is worthy the gallant Richelieu. That
piece of plate was ordered of Goldsmith Lucas by the Regent of<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>
Orleans. Subject: the Amours of the Bacchantes and Satyrs&mdash;rather
free."</p>

<p>More than free, obscene&mdash;but Balsamo admired the calm
unconcern of Andrea, not blenching as she presented the plate.</p>

<p>"Do eat," said the host; "do not fancy that another dish
is coming, for you will be dreadfully disappointed."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, father," interrupted the girl with habitual
coolness, "but if Nicole has understood me, she will have
made a cake of which I told her the recipe."</p>

<p>"You gave Nicole the recipe of a cake? Your waiting maid
does the cooking now, eh? The next thing will be your doing
it yourself. Do you find duchesses and countesses playing
the kitchen-wench? On the contrary, the king makes
omelets for them. Gracious! that I have lived to see women-cooks
under my roof. Pray excuse my daughter, baron."</p>

<p>"We must eat, father," rebuked Andrea tranquilly.
"Dish up, Legay!" she called out, and the girl brought in a
pancake of appetizing smell.</p>

<p>"I know one who won't touch the stuff," cried Taverney,
furiously dashing his plate to pieces.</p>

<p>"But the gentleman, perhaps, will," said the lady coldly.
"By the way, father, that leaves only seventeen pieces in that
set, which comes to me from my mother."</p>

<p>The guest's spirit of observation found plenty of food in
this corner of life in the country. The salt dish alone revealed
a facet of Taverney's character or rather all its sides.
From curiosity or otherwise, he stared at Andrea with such
perseverance that she tried to frown him down; but finally
she gave way and yielded to his mesmeric influence and command.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the baron was storming, grumbling, snarling
and nipping the arm of Labrie, who happened to get into his
way. He would have done the same to Nicole's when the
baron's gaze fell on her hands.</p>

<p>"Just look at what pretty fingers this lass has," he exclaimed.
"They would be supremely pretty only for her
kitchen work having made corns at the tips. That is right;
perk up, my girl! I can tell you, my dear guest, that Nicole
Legay is not a prude like her mistress and compliments do not
frighten her."</p>

<p>Watching the baron's daughter, Balsamo noticed the highest
disdain on her beauteous face. He harmonized his features
with hers and this pleased her, spite of herself, for she looked
at him with less harshness, or, better, with less disquiet.</p>

<p>"This girl, only think," continued the poor noble, chucking
the girl's chin with the back of his hand, "was at the
nunnery with my daughter and picked up as much schooling.
She does not leave her mistress a moment. This devotion
would rejoice the philosophers, who grant souls to her class."</p>

<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>

<p>"Father, Nicole stays with me because I order her to do
so," observed Andrea, discontented.</p>

<p>By the curl of the servant's lip, Balsamo saw that she was not
insensible to the humiliations from her proud superior. But
the expression flitted; and to hide a tear, perhaps, the girl
looked aside to a window on the yard. Everything interested
the visitor, and he perceived a man's face at the panes.</p>

<p>Each in this curious abode had a secret, he thought; "I
hope not to be an hour here without learning Andrea's.
Already I know her father's, and I guess Nicole's."</p>

<p>Taverney perceived his short absence of mind.</p>

<p>"What! are you dreaming?" he questioned. "We are all
at it, here; but you might have waited for bedtime. Reverie
is a catching complaint. My daughter broods; Nicole is wool-gathering;
and I get puzzling about that dawdler who killed
these birds&mdash;and dreams when he kills them. Gilbert is a
philosopher, like Labrie. I hope you are not friendly with
them? I forewarn you that philosophers do not go down with
me."</p>

<p>"They are neither friends nor foes to me," replied the visitor;
"I do not have anything to do with them."</p>

<p>"Very good. Zounds, they are scoundrelly vermin, more
venomous than ugly. They will ruin the monarchy with
their maxims, like 'People can hardly be virtuous under a
monarchy;' or, 'Genuine monarchy is an institution devised
to corrupt popular manners, and make slaves;' or yet, 'Royal
authority may come by the grace of God, but so do plagues
and miseries of mankind.' Pretty flummery, all this! What
good would a virtuous people be, I beg? Things are going to
the bad, since his Majesty spoke to Voltaire and read Diderot's
book."</p>

<p>At this Balsamo fancied again to spy the pale face at the
window, but it vanished as soon as he fixed his eyes upon it.</p>

<p>"Is your daughter a philosopher?" he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"I do not know what philosophy is; I only know that I
like serious matters," was Andrea's reply.</p>

<p>"The most serious thing is to live; stick to that," said her
father.</p>

<p>"But the young lady cannot hate life," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"All depends," she said.</p>

<p>"Another stupid saying," interrupted Taverney. "That is
just the nonsense my son talks. I have the misfortune to
have a son. The Viscount of Taverney is cornet in the dauphin's
horse-guards&mdash;a nice boy; another philosopher! The
other day he talked to me about doing away with negro
slavery. 'What are we to do for sugar?' I retorted, for I
like my coffee heavily sweetened, as does Louis XV. 'We
must do without sugar to benefit a suffering race.' 'Suffering
monkeys!' I returned, 'and that is paying them a compli<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>ment.'
Whereupon he asserted that all men were brothers!
Madness must be in the air. I, brother of a blackamoor!"</p>

<p>"This is going too far," observed Balsamo.</p>

<p>"Of course. I told you I was in luck. My children are&mdash;one
an angel, the other an apostle. Drink, though my wine
is detestable."</p>

<p>"I think it exquisite," said the guest, watching Andrea.</p>

<p>"Then you are a philosopher! In my time we learnt pleasant
things; we played cards, fought duels, though against the
law; and wasted our time on duchesses and money on opera
dancers. That is my story in a nutshell. Taverney went
wholly into the opera-house; which is all I sorrow for, since
a poor noble is nothing of a man. I look aged, do I not? Only
because I am impoverished and dwell in a kennel, with a tattered
wig, and gothic coat; but my friend the marshal duke,
with his house in town and two hundred thousand a year&mdash;he
is young, in his new clothes and brushed up perukes&mdash;he is
still alert, brisk and pleasure-seeking, though ten years my
senior, my dear sir, ten years."</p>

<p>"I am astonished that, with powerful friends like the Duke
of Richelieu, you quitted the court."</p>

<p>"Only a temporary retreat, and I am going back one day,"
said the lord, darting a strange glance on his daughter, which
the visitor intercepted.</p>

<p>"But, I suppose, the duke befriends your son?"</p>

<p>"He holds the son of his friend in horror, for he is a philosopher,
and he execrates them."</p>

<p>"The feeling is reciprocal," observed Andrea with perfect
calm. "Clear away, Legay!"</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_33"></a><!--TN: Quote removed from before "Startled" on Page 31-->Startled from her vigilant watch on the window, the maid
ran back to the table.</p>

<p>"We used to stay at the board to two <span class="smaller">A. M.</span> We had luxuries
for supper, then, that's why! and we drank when we
could eat no more. But how can one drink vinegar when
there is nothing to eat? Legay, let us have the Maraschino,
provided there is any."</p>

<p>"Liqueurs," said Andrea to the maid, who took her orders
from the baron thus second-hand.</p>

<p>Her master sank back in his armchair and sighed with
grotesque melancholy while keeping his eyes closed.</p>

<p>"Albeit the duke may execrate your son&mdash;quite right, too,
as he is a philosopher," said Balsamo, "he ought to preserve
his liking for you, who are nothing of the kind. I presume
you have claims on the king, whom you must have served?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen years in the army. I was the marshal's aid-de-camp,
and we went through the Mahon campaign together.
Our friendship dates from&mdash;let me see! the famous siege of
Philipsburg, 1742 to 1743."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there, and remember you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>

<p>"You remember me at the <a name="tn_png_34"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "seige?" on Page 32-->siege? Why, what is your
age?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am no particular age," replied the guest, holding up
his glass to be filled by Andrea's fair hand.</p>

<p>The host interpreted that his guest did not care to tell his
years.</p>

<p>"My lord, allow me to say that you do not seem to have been
a soldier, then, as it is twenty-eight years ago, and you are
hardly over thirty."</p>

<p>Andrea regarded the stranger with the steadfastness of deep
curiosity; he came out in a different light every instant.</p>

<p>"I know what I am talking about the famous siege,
where the Duke of Richelieu killed in a duel his cousin the
Prince of Lixen. The encounter came off on the highway,
by my fay! on our return from the outposts; on the embankment,
to the left, he ran him through the body. I came up
as Prince Deux-ponts held the dying man in his arms. He
was seated on the ditch bank, while Richelieu tranquilly
wiped his steel."</p>

<p>"On my honor, my lord, you astound me. Things passed
as you describe."</p>

<p>"Stay, you wore a captain's uniform then, in the Queen's
Light Horse Guards, so badly cut up at Fontenoy?"</p>

<p>"Were you in that battle, too?" jeered the baron.</p>

<p>"No, I was dead at that time," replied the stranger,
calmly.</p>

<p>The baron stared, Andrea shuddered, and Nicole made the
sign of the cross.</p>

<p>"To resume the subject, I recall you clearly now, as you
held your horse and the duke's while he fought. I went up
to you for an account and you gave it. They called you the
Little Chevalier. Excuse me not remembering before, but
thirty years change a man. To the health of Marshal Richelieu,
my dear baron!"</p>

<p>"But, according to this, you would be upward of fifty."</p>

<p>"I am of the age to have witnessed that affair."</p>

<p>The baron dropped back in the chair so vexed that Nicole
could not help laughing. But Andrea, instead of laughing,
mused with her looks on the mysterious guest. He seemed
to await this chance to dart two or three flaming glances at
her, which thrilled her like an electrical discharge. Her arms
stiffened, her neck bent, she smiled against her will on the
hypnotizer, and closed her eyes. He managed to touch her
arm, and again she quivered.</p>

<p>"Do you think I tell a fib in asserting I was at Philipsburg?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"No, I believe you," she replied with a great effort.</p>

<p>"I am in my dotage," muttered Taverney, "unless we have
a ghost here."</p>

<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>

<p>"Who can tell?" returned Balsamo, with so grave an accent
that he subjugated the lady and made Nicole stare.</p>

<p>"But if you were living at the Siege, you were a child of
four or <a name="tn_png_35"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "five." on Page 33-->five."</p>

<p>"I was over forty."</p>

<p>The baron laughed and Nicole echoed him.</p>

<p>"You do not believe me. It is plain, though, for I was not
the man I am."</p>

<p>"This is a bit of antiquity," said the French noble. "Was
there not a Greek philosopher&mdash;these vile philosophers seem to
be of all ages&mdash;who would not eat beans because they contained
souls, like the negress, according to my son? What
the deuse was his name?"</p>

<p>"That is the gentleman."</p>

<p>"Why may I not be Pythagoras?"</p>

<p>"Pythagoras," prompted Andrea.</p>

<p>"I do not deny that, but he was not at Philipsburg; or, at
any rate, I did not see him there."</p>

<p>"But you saw Viscount Jean Barreaux, one of the Black
Horse Musketeers?"</p>

<p>"Rather; the musketeers and the light cavalry took turns
in guarding the trenches."</p>

<p>"The day after the Richelieu duel, Barreaux and you were
in the trenches when he asked you for a pinch of snuff, which
you offered in a gold box, ornamented with the portrait of a
belle, but in the act a cannon ball hit him in the throat, as
happened the Duke of Berwick aforetimes, and carried away
his head."</p>

<p>"Gad! just so! poor Barreaux!"</p>

<p>"This proves that we were acquainted there, for I am
Barreaux," said the foreigner.</p>

<p>The host shrank back in fright or stupefaction.</p>

<p>"This is magic," he gasped; "you would have been burnt
at the stake a hundred years ago, my dear guest. I seem to
smell brimstone!"</p>

<p>"My dear baron, note that a true magician is never burnt
or hanged. Only fools are led to the gibbet or pyre. But
here is your daughter sent to sleep by our discussions on
metaphysics and occult sciences, not calculated to interest a
lady."</p>

<p>Indeed, Andrea nodded under irresistible force like a lily
on the stalk. At these words she made an effort to repel the
subtle fluid which overwhelmed her; she shook her head energetically,
rose and tottered out of the room, sustained by
Nicole. At the same time disappeared the face glued so often
to the window glass on the outside, which Balsamo had recognized
as Gilbert's.</p>

<p>"<i>Eureka!</i>" exclaimed Balsamo triumphantly, as she vanished.
"I can say it like Archimedes."</p>

<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>

<p>"Who is he?" inquired the baron.</p>

<p>"A very good fellow for a wizard, whom I knew over two
thousand years ago," replied the guest.</p>

<p>Whether the baron thought this boast rather too preposterous,
or he did not hear it, or hearing it, wanted the more to
be rid of his odd guest, he proposed lending him a horse to get
to the nearest posting house.</p>

<p>"What, force me to ride when I am dying to stretch my
legs in bed? Do not exaggerate your mediocrity so as to
make me believe in a personal ill will."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I treat you as a friend, knowing what
you will incur here. But since you put it this way, remain.
Labrie, is the Red-Room habitable?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lord, as it is Master Philip's when he is
<a name="tn_png_36"></a><!--TN: "ere" changed to "here" on Page 34-->here."</p>

<p>"Give it to the gentleman, since he is bent on being disgusted
with Taverney."</p>

<p>"I want to be here to-morrow to testify to my gratitude."</p>

<p>"You can do that easily, as you are so friendly with Old
Nick that you can ask him for the stone which turns all things
to gold."</p>

<p>"If that is what you want, apply to me direct."</p>

<p>"Labrie, you old rogue, get a candle and light the gentleman
to bed," said the baron, beginning to find such a dialogue
dangerous at the late hour.</p>

<p>Labrie ordered Nicole to air the Red Room while he hastened
to obey. Nicole left Andrea alone, the latter eager for the
solitude to nurse her thoughts. Taverney bade the guest
good-night, and went to bed.</p>

<p>Balsamo took out his watch, for he recalled his promise to
awake Althotas after two hours, and it was a half-hour more.
He asked the servant if his coach was still out in the yard,
and Labrie answered in the affirmative&mdash;unless it had run
off of its own volition. As for Gilbert, he had been abed
most likely since an hour.</p>

<p>Balsamo went to Althotas after studying the way to the
Red Room. Labrie was tidying up the sordid apartment,
after Nicole had aired it, when the guest returned.</p>

<p>He had paused at Andrea's room to listen at her door to her
playing on the harpsichord to dispel the burden of the influence
the stranger had imposed upon her. In a while he
waved his hands as in throwing a magic spell, and so it was,
for Andrea slowly stopped playing, let her hands drop by
her sides, and turned rigidly and slowly toward the door,
like one who obeys an influence foreign to will.</p>

<p>Balsamo smiled in the darkness as though he could see
through the panels. This was all he wanted to do, for he
groped for the banister rail, and went up stairs to his room.</p>

<p>As he departed, Andrea turned away from the door and<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>
resumed playing, so that the mesmerist heard the air again
from where she had been made to leave off.</p>

<p>Entering the Red Room, he dismissed Labrie; but the latter
lingered, feeling in the depths of his pocket till at last he
managed to say:</p>

<p>"My lord, you made a mistake this evening, in giving me
gold for the piece of silver you intended."</p>

<p>Balsamo looked on the old servingman with admiration,
showing that he had not a high opinion of the honesty of
most men.</p>

<p>"'And honest,'" he muttered in the words of Hamlet, as
he took out a second gold coin to place it beside the other
in the old man's hand.</p>

<p>The latter's delight at this splendid generosity may be
imagined, for he had not seen so much gold in twenty years.
He was retiring, bowing to the floor, when the donor checked
him.</p>

<p>"What are the morning habits of the house?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My lord stays abed late, my lord; but Mademoiselle
Andrea is up betimes, about six."</p>

<p>"Who sleeps overhead?"</p>

<p>"I, my lord; but nobody beneath, as the vestibule is under
us."</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, do not be alarmed if you see a light in
my <a name="tn_png_37"></a><!--TN: "couch" changed to "coach" on Page 35-->coach, as <a name="tn_png_37a"></a><!--TN: "on" changed to "an" on Page 35-->an old impotent servant inhabits it. Ask
Master Gilbert to let me see him in the morning."</p>

<p>"Is my lord going away so soon?"</p>

<p>"It depends," replied Balsamo, with a smile. "I ought to
be at Bar-le-Duc tomorrow evening."</p>

<p>Labrie sighed with resignation, and was about to set fire to
some old papers to warm the room, which was damp and
there was no wood, when Balsamo stayed him.</p>

<p>"No, let them be; I might want to read them, for I may
not sleep."</p>

<p>Balsamo went to the door to listen to the servant's departing
steps making the stairs creak till they sounded overhead;
Labrie was in his own room. Then he went to the
window. In the other wing was a lighted window, with half-drawn
curtains, facing him. Legay was leisurely taking off
her neckerchief, often peeping down into the yard.</p>

<p>"Striking resemblance," muttered the baron.</p>

<p>The light went out though the girl had not gone to rest.
The watcher stood up against the wall. The harpsichord still
sounded, with no other noise. He opened his door, went
down stairs with caution, and opened the door of Andrea's
sitting-room.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped in the melancholy strain, although she
had not heard the intruder. As she was trying to recall the
thrill which had mastered her, it came anew. She shivered all<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>
over. In the mirror she saw movement. The shadow in the
doorway could only be her father or a servant. Nothing
more natural.</p>

<p>But she saw with spiritual eyes that it was none of these.</p>

<p>"My lord," she faltered, "in heaven's name, what want
you?"</p>

<p>It was the stranger, in the black velvet riding coat, for he
had discarded his silken suit, in which a mesmerist cannot
well work his power.</p>

<p>She tried to rise, but could not; she tried to open her mouth
to scream, but with a pass of both hands Balsamo froze the
sound on her lips.</p>

<p>With no strength or will, Andrea let her head sink on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>At this juncture Balsamo believed he heard a noise at the
window. Quickly turning, he caught sight of a man's face
beyond. He frowned, and, strangely enough, the same impression
flitted across the medium's face.</p>

<p>"Sleep!" he commanded, lowering the hands he had held
above her head with a smooth gesture, and persevering in filling
her with the mesmeric fluid in crushing columns. "I
will you to sleep."</p>

<p>All yielded to this mighty will. Andrea leaned her elbow
on the musical-instrument case, her head on her hand, and
slept.</p>

<p>The mesmerist retired backward, drew the door to, and went
back to his room. As soon as the door closed, the face he had
seen reappeared at the window; it was Gilbert's.</p>

<p>Excluded from the parlor by his inferior position in
Taverney Castle, he had watched all the persons through the
evening whose rank allowed them to figure in it. During the
supper he had noticed Baron Balsamo gesticulate and smile, and
his peculiar attention bestowed on the lady of the house; the
master's unheard-of affability to him, and Labrie's respectful
eagerness.</p>

<p>Later on, when they rose from table, he hid in a clump of
lilacs and snowballs, for fear that Nicole, closing the blinds
or in going to her room, should catch him eavesdropping.</p>

<p>But Gilbert had other designs this evening than spying.
He waited, without clearly knowing for what. When he saw
the light in the maid's window, he crossed the yard on tiptoe
and crouched down in the gloom to peer in at the window at
Andrea playing the harpsichord.</p>

<p>This was the moment when the mesmerist entered the room.</p>

<p>At this sight, Gilbert started and his ardent gaze covered the
magician and his victim.</p>

<p>But he imagined that Balsamo complimented the lady on
her musical talent, to which she replied with her customary
coldness; but he had persisted with a smile so that she sus<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>pended
her practice and answered. He admired the grace
with which the visitor retired.</p>

<p>Of all the interview which he fancied he read aright, he
had understood nothing, for what really happened was in the
mind, in silence.</p>

<p>However keen an observer he was, he could not divine a
mystery, where everything had passed quite naturally.</p>

<p>Balsamo gone, Gilbert remained, not watching, but contemplating
Andrea, lovely in her thoughtful pose, till he perceived
with astonishment that she was slumbering. When convinced
of this, he grasped his head between his hands like one
who fears his brain will burst from the overflow of emotions.</p>

<p>"Oh, to kiss her hand!" he murmured, in a gush of fury.
"Oh, Gilbert, let us approach her&mdash;I so long to do it."</p>

<p>Hardly had he entered the room than he felt the importance
of his intrusion. The timid if not respectful son of a farmer
to dare to raise his eyes on that proud daughter of the peers.
If he should touch the hem of her dress she would blast him
with a glance.</p>

<p>The floor boards creaked under his wary tread, but she did
not move, though he was bathed in cold perspiration.</p>

<p>"She sleeps&mdash;oh, happiness, she sleeps!" he panted, drawing
with irresistible attraction within a yard of the statue, of
which he took the sleeve and kissed it.</p>

<p>Holding his breath, slowly he raised his eyes, seeking hers.
They were wide open, but still saw not. Intoxicated by the
delusion that she expected his visit and her silence was consent,
her quiet a favor, he lifted her hand to his lips and impressed
a long and feverish kiss.</p>

<p>She shuddered and repulsed him.</p>

<p>"I am lost!" he gasped, dropping the hand and beating the
floor with his forehead.</p>

<p>Andrea rose as though moved by a spring under her feet,
passed by Gilbert, crushed by shame and terror and with no
power to crave pardon, and proceeded to the door. With
high-held head and <a name="tn_png_39"></a><!--TN: "oustretched" changed to "outstretched" on Page 37-->outstretched neck, as if drawn by a secret
power toward an invisible goal, she opened the door and
walked out on the landing.</p>

<p>The youth rose partly and watched her take the stairs. He
crawled after her, pale, trembling and astonished.</p>

<p>"She is going to tell the baron and have me scourged out
of the house&mdash;no, she goes up to where the guest is lodged.
For she would have rung, or called, if she wanted Labrie."</p>

<p>He clenched his fists at the bare idea that Andrea was going
into the strange gentleman's room. All this seemed monstrous.
And yet that was her end.</p>

<p>That door was ajar. She pushed it open without knocking;
the lamplight streamed on her pure profile and whirled golden
reflections into her wildly open eyes.</p>

<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>

<p>In the center of the room Gilbert saw the baron standing,
with fixed gaze and wrinkled brow, and his hand extended
in gesture of command, ere the door swung to.</p>

<p>Gilbert's forces failed him; he wheeled round on the stairs,
clinging to the rail, but slid down, with his eyes fastened to
the last on the cursed panel, behind which was sealed up all
his vanished dream, present happiness and future hope.</p>

<p>"I bade you sleep. Do you sleep?"</p>

<p>Andrea sighed and nodded with an effort.</p>

<p>"It is well. Sit here," and he led her by the hand the
youth had kissed to a chair, which she took.</p>

<p>"Now, see!"</p>

<p>Her eyes dilated as though to collect all the luminous rays
in the room.</p>

<p>"I did not tell you to see with your eyes," said he, "but with
those of the soul."</p>

<p>He touched her with a steel rod which he drew from under
his waistcoat. She started as though a fiery dart had transfixed
her and her eyes closed instantly; her darkening face expressed
the sharpest astonishment.</p>

<p>"Tell me where you are."</p>

<p>"In the Red Room, with you, and I am ashamed and
afraid."</p>

<p>"What of? Are we not in sympathy, and do you not know
that my intentions are pure, and that I respect you like a
sister?"</p>

<p>"You may not mean evil to me, but it is not so as regards
others."</p>

<p>"Possibly," said the magician; "but do not heed that," he
added in a tone of command. "Are all asleep under this
roof?"</p>

<p>"All, save my father who is reading one of those bad books,
which he pesters me to read, but I will not."</p>

<p>"Good; we are safe in that quarter. Look where Nicole
is."</p>

<p>"She is in her room, in the dark, but I need not the light to
see that she is slipping out of it to go and hide behind the yard
door to watch."</p>

<p>"To watch you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then, it matters not. When a girl is safe from her father
and her attendant, she has nothing to fear, unless she is in
love&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>

<p>"I, love?" she said sneeringly. And shaking her head, she
added sadly: "My heart is free."</p>

<p>Such an expression of candor and virginal modesty embellished
her features that Balsamo radiantly muttered:</p>

<p>"A lily&mdash;a pupil&mdash;a seer!" clasping his hands in delight.
"But, without loving, you may be loved?"</p>

<p>"I know not; and yet, since I returned from school, a
youth has watched me, and even now he is weeping at the
foot of the stairs."</p>

<p>"See his face!"</p>

<p>"He hides it in his hands."</p>

<p>"See through them."</p>

<p>"Gilbert!" she uttered with an effort. "Impossible that he
would presume to love me!"</p>

<p>Balsamo smiled at her deep disdain, like one who knew that
love will leap any distance.</p>

<p>"What is he doing now?"</p>

<p>"He puts down his hands, he musters up courage to mount
hither&mdash;no, he has not the courage&mdash;he flees."</p>

<p>She smiled with scorn.</p>

<p>"Cease to look that way. Speak of the Baron of Taverney.
He is too poor to give you any amusements?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"You are dying of tedium here; for you have ambition?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Love for your father?"</p>

<p>"Yes; though I bear him a grudge for squandering my
mother's fortune so that poor Redcastle pines in the garrison
and cannot wear our name handsomely."</p>

<p>"Who is Redcastle?"</p>

<p>"My brother Philip is called the Knight of Redcastle from
a property of the eldest son, and will wear it till father's death
entitles him to be 'Taverney.'"</p>

<p>"Do you love your brother?"</p>

<p>"Dearly, above all else; because he has a noble heart, and
would give his life for me."</p>

<p>"More than your father would. Where is Redcastle?"</p>

<p>"At Strasburg in the garrison; no, he has gone&mdash;oh, dear
Philip!" continued the medium with sparkling eyes in joy.
"I see him riding through a town I know. It is Nancy, where
I was at the convent school. The torches round him light up
his darling face."</p>

<p>"Why torches?" asked Balsamo in amaze.</p>

<p>"They are around him on horseback, and a handsome
gilded carriage."</p>

<p>Balsamo appeared to have a guess at this, for he only said:</p>

<p>"Who is in the coach?"</p>

<p>"A lovely, graceful, majestic woman, but I seem to have
seen her before&mdash;how strange! no, I am wrong&mdash;she looks like<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>
our Nicole; but as the lily is like the jessamine. She leans
out of the coach window and beckons Philip to draw near.
He takes his hat off with respect as she orders him, with a
smile, to hurry on the horses. She says that the escort must be
ready at six in the morning, as she wishes to take a rest in the
daytime&mdash;oh, it is at Taverney that she means to stop. She
wants to see my father! So grand a princess stop at our
shabby house! What shall we do without linen or plate?"</p>

<p>"Be of good cheer. We will provide all that."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!"</p>

<p>The girl, who had partly risen, fell back in the chair, uttering
a profound sigh.</p>

<p>"Regain your strength," said the magician, drawing the
excess of magnetism from the beautiful body, which bent as
if broken, and the fair head heavily resting on the heaving
bosom. "I shall require all your lucidity presently. O,
Science! you alone never deceive man. To none other ought
man sacrifice his all. This is a lovely woman, a pure angel
as Thou knowest who created angels. But what is this
beauty and this innocence to me now?&mdash;only worth what information
they afford. I care not though this fair darling
dies, as long as she tells me what I seek. Let all worldly
delights perish&mdash;love, passion and ecstasy, if I may tread the
path surely and well lighted. Now, maiden, that, in a few
seconds, my power has given you the repose of ages, plunge
once more into your mesmeric slumber. This time, speak for
myself alone."</p>

<p>He made the passes which replaced Andrea in repose.
From his bosom he drew the folded paper containing the
tress of black hair, from which the perfume had made the
paper transparent. He laid it in Andrea's hand, saying:</p>

<p>"See!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a woman!"</p>

<p>"Joy!" cried Balsamo. "Science is not a mere name like
virtue. Mesmer has vanquished Brutus. Depict this woman,
that I may recognize her."</p>

<p>"Tall, dark, but with blue eyes, her hair like this, her arms
sinewy."</p>

<p>"What is she doing?"</p>

<p>"Racing as though carried off on a fine black horse, flecked
with foam. She takes the road yonder to Chalons."</p>

<p>"Good! my own road," said Balsamo. "I was going to
Paris, and there we shall meet. You may repose now," and
he took back the lock of hair.</p>

<p>Andrea's arms fell motionless again along her body.</p>

<p>"Recover strength, and go back to your harpsichord,"
said the mesmerist, enveloping her, as she rose, with a fresh
supply of magnetism.</p>

<p>Andrea acted like the racehorse which overtaxes itself to<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
accomplish the master's will, however unfair. She walked
through the doorway, where he had opened the door, and,
still asleep, descended the stairs slowly.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE MAID AND THE MISTRESS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Gilbert</span> had passed this time in unspeakable anguish.
Balsamo was but a man, but he was a strong one, and the
youth was weak: He had attempted twenty times to mount
to the assault of the guest room, but his trembling limbs gave
way under him and he fell on his knees.</p>

<p>Then the idea struck him to get the gardener's ladder and
by its means climb up outside to the <a name="tn_png_43"></a><!--TN: "widdow" changed to "window" on Page 41-->window, and listen and
spy. But as he stooped to pick up this ladder, lying on the
grass where he remembered, he heard a rustling noise by the
house, and he turned.</p>

<p>He let the ladder fall, for he fancied he saw a shade flit
across the doorway. His terror made him believe it, not a
ghost&mdash;he was a budding philosopher who did not credit them&mdash;but
Baron Taverney. His conscience whispered another
name, and he looked up to the second floor. But Nicole had
put out her light, and not another, or a sound came from all
over the house&mdash;the guest's room excepted.</p>

<p>Seeing and hearing nothing, convinced that he had deluded
himself, Gilbert took up the ladder and had set foot on
it to climb where he placed it, when Andrea came down from
Balsamo's room. With a lacerated heart, Gilbert forgot all
to follow her into the parlor where again she sat at the instrument;
her candle still burned beside it.</p>

<p>Gilbert tore his bosom with his nails to think that here he
had kissed the hem of her robe with such reverence. Her
condescension must spring from one of those fits of corruption
recorded in the vile books which he had read&mdash;some freak
of the senses.</p>

<p>But as he was going to invade the room again, a hand came
out of the darkness and energetically grasped him by the arm.</p>

<p>"So I have caught you, base deceiver! Try to deny again
that you love her and have an appointment with her!"</p>

<p>Gilbert had not the power to break from the clutch, though
he might readily have done so, for it was only a girl's. Nicole
Legay held him a prisoner.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he said testily.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to speak out aloud?"</p>

<p>"No, no; be quiet," he stammered, dragging her out of the
antechamber.</p>

<p>"Then follow me!" which was what Gilbert wanted, as
this was removing Nicole from her mistress.</p>

<p>He could with a word have proved that while he might be<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>
guilty of loving the lady, the latter was not an accomplice;
but the secret of Andrea was one that enriches a man, whether
with love or lucre.</p>

<p>"Come to my room," she said; "who would surprise us
there! Not my young lady, though she may well be jealous
of her fine gallant! But folks in the secret are not to be
dreaded. The honorable lady jealous of the servant,&mdash;I never
expected such an <a name="tn_png_44"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "honor!" on Page 42-->honor! It is I who am jealous, for you
love me no more."</p>

<p>In plainness, Nicole's bedroom did not differ from the others
in that dwelling. She sat on the edge of the bed, and Gilbert
on the dressing-case, which Andrea had given her maid.</p>

<p>Coming up the stairs, Nicole had calmed herself, but the
youth felt anger rise as it cooled in the girl.</p>

<p>"So you love our young lady," began Nicole with a kindling
eye. "You have love-trysts with her; or will you pretend
you went only to consult the magician?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, for you know I feel ambition&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Greed, you mean?"</p>

<p>"It is the same thing, as you take it."</p>

<p>"Don't let us bandy words: you avoid me lately."</p>

<p>"I seek solitude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you want to go up into solitude by a ladder? Beg
pardon, I did not know that was the way to it."</p>

<p>Gilbert was beaten in the first defenses.</p>

<p>"You had better out with it, that you love me no longer,
or love us both."</p>

<p>"That would only be an error of society, for in some countries
men have several wives."</p>

<p>"Savages!" exclaimed the servant, testily.</p>

<p>"Philosophers!" retorted Gilbert.</p>

<p>"But you would not like me to have two beaux on my
string?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish tyrannically and unjustly to restrain the
impulses of your heart. Liberty consists in respecting free
will. So, change your affection, for fidelity is not natural&mdash;to
some."</p>

<p>Discussion was the youth's strong point; he knew little, but
more than the girl. So he began to regain coolness.</p>

<p>"Have you a good memory, Master Philosopher?" said
Nicole. "Do you remember when I came back from the nunnery
with mistress, and you consoled me, and taking me in
your arms, said: 'You are an orphan like me; let us be
brother and sister through similar misfortune.' Did you
mean what you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, then; but five months have changed me; I think
otherwise at present."</p>

<p>"You mean you will not wed me? Yet Nicole Legay is
worth a Gilbert, it seems to me."</p>

<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>

<p>"All men are equal; but nature or education improves or
depreciates them. As their faculties or acquirements expand,
they part from one another."</p>

<p>"I understand that we must part, and that you are a
scamp. How ever could I fancy such a fellow?"</p>

<p>"Nicole, I am never going to marry, but be a learned man
or a philosopher. Learning requires the isolation of the mind;
philosophy that of the body."</p>

<p>"Master Gilbert, you are a scoundrel, and not worth a girl
like me. But you laugh," she continued, with a dry smile
more ominous than his satirical laugh; "do not make war
with me; for I shall do such deeds that you will be sorry, for
they will fall on your head, for having turned me astray."</p>

<p>"You are growing wiser; and I am convinced now that
you would refuse me if I sued you."</p>

<p>Nicole reflected, clenching her hands and gritting her
teeth.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right, Gilbert," she said; "I, too, see my
horizon enlarge, and believe I am fated for better things than
to be so mean as a philosopher's wife. Go back to your ladder,
sirrah, and try not to break your neck, though I believe it
would be a blessing to others, and may be for yourself."</p>

<p>Gilbert hesitated for a space in indecision, for Nicole, excited
by love and spite, was a ravishing creature; but he had
determined to break with her, as she hampered his passion and
his aspirations.</p>

<p>"Gone," murmured Nicole in a few seconds.</p>

<p>She ran to the window, but all was dark. She went to her
mistress' door, where she listened.</p>

<p>"She is asleep; but I will know all about it to-morrow."</p>

<p>It was broad day when Andrea de Taverney awoke.</p>

<p>In trying to rise, she felt such lassitude and sharp pain that
she fell back on the pillow uttering a groan.</p>

<p>"Goodness, what is the matter?" cried Nicole, who had
opened the curtains.</p>

<p>"I do not know. I feel lame all over; my chest seems
broken in."</p>

<p>"It is the outbreak of the cold you caught last night,"
said the maid.</p>

<p>"Last night?" repeated the surprised lady; but she remarked
the disorder of her room, and added: "Stay, I
remember that I felt very tired&mdash;exhausted&mdash;it must have
been the storm. I fell to sleep over my music. I recall
nothing further. I went up hither half asleep, and must have
thrown myself on the bed without undressing <a name="tn_png_45"></a><!--TN: Single quote changed to a double quote after "properly." on Page 43-->properly."</p>

<p>"You must have stayed very late at the music, then,"
observed Nicole, "for, before you retired to your bedroom
I came down, having heard steps about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I did not stir from the parlor."</p>

<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>

<p>"Oh, of course, you know better than me," said Nicole.</p>

<p>"You must mistake," replied the other with the utmost
sweetness: "I never left the seat; but I remember that I
was cold, for I walked quite swiftly."</p>

<p>"When I saw you in the garden, however, you walked
very freely."</p>

<p>"I, in the grounds?&mdash;you know I never go out after dark."</p>

<p>"I should think I knew my mistress by sight," said the
maid, doubling her scrutiny; "I thought that you were taking
a stroll with somebody."</p>

<p>"With whom would I be taking a stroll?" demanded Andrea,
without seeing that her servant was putting her to an
examination.</p>

<p>Nicole did not think it prudent to proceed, for the coolness
of the hypocrite, as she considered her, frightened her. So
she changed the subject.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not going to be sick, either with fatigue or
sorrow. Both have the same effect. Ah, well I know how
sorrows undermine!"</p>

<p>"You do? Have you sorrows, Nicole?"</p>

<p>"Indeed; I was coming to tell my mistress, when I was
frightened to see how queer you looked; no doubt, we both
are upset."</p>

<p>"Really!" queried Andrea, offended at the "we both."</p>

<p>"I am thinking of getting married."</p>

<p>"Why, you are not yet seventeen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you are sixteen and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was going to say something saucy, but she knew Andrea
too well to risk it, and cut short the explanation.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I cannot know what my mistress thinks, but I am
low-born and I act according to my nature. It is natural to
have a sweetheart."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have a lover <a name="tn_png_46"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "then!" on Page 44-->then! You seem to make good use
of your time here."</p>

<p>"I must look forward. You are a lady and have expectations
from rich kinsfolks going off; but I have no family and
must get into one."</p>

<p>As all this <a name="tn_png_46a"></a><!--TN: "semed" changed to "seemed" on Page 44-->seemed straightforward enough, Andrea forgot
what had been offensive in tone, and said, with her kindness
taking the reins:</p>

<p>"Is it any one I know? Speak out, as it is the duty of
masters to interest themselves in the fate of their servants,
and I am pleased with you."</p>

<p>"That is very kind. It is&mdash;Gilbert!"</p>

<p>To her high amaze, Andrea did not wince.</p>

<p>"As he loves you, marry him," she replied, easily. "He
is an orphan, too, so you are both your own masters. Only,
you are both rather young."</p>

<p>"We shall have the longer life together."</p>

<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>

<p>"You are penniless."</p>

<p>"We can work."</p>

<p>"What can he do, who is good for nothing?"</p>

<p>"He is good to catch game for master's table, anyway;
you slander poor Gilbert, who is full of attention for you."</p>

<p>"He does his duty as a servant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay; he is not a servant; he is never paid."</p>

<p>"He is son of a farmer of ours; he is kept and does
nothing for it; so, he steals his support. But what are you
aiming at to defend so warmly a boy whom nobody attacks?"</p>

<p>"I never thought you would attack him! it is just the
other way about!" with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>"Something more I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Because you do not want to."</p>

<p>"Enough! I have no leisure for your riddles. You want
my consent to this marriage?"</p>

<p>"If you please; and I hope you will bear Gilbert no ill
will."</p>

<p>"What is it to me whether he loves you or not? You
burden me, miss."</p>

<p>"I daresay," said Nicole, bursting out in anger at last;
"you have said the same thing to Gilbert."</p>

<p>"I speak to your Gilbert! You are mad, girl; leave me in
peace."</p>

<p>"If you do not speak to him now, I believe the silence will
not last long."</p>

<p>"Lord forgive her&mdash;the silly jade is jealous!" exclaimed
Andrea, covering her with a disdainful look, and laughing.
"Cheer up, little Legay! I never looked at your pretty Gilbert,
and I do not so much as know the color of his eyes."</p>

<p>Andrea was quite ready to overlook what seemed folly and
not pertness; but Nicole felt offended, and did not want
pardon.</p>

<p>"I can quite believe that&mdash;for one cannot get a good look
in the nighttime."</p>

<p>"Take care to make yourself clear at once," said Andrea,
very pale.</p>

<p>"Last night, I saw&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Andrea!" came a voice from below, in the garden.</p>

<p>"My lord your father," said Nicole, "with the stranger
who passed the night here."</p>

<p>"Go down, and say that I cannot answer, as I am not well.
I have a stiff neck; and return to finish this odd debate."</p>

<p>Nicole obeyed, as Andrea was always obeyed when commanding,
without reply or wavering. Her mistress felt
something unusual; though resolved not to show herself, she
was constrained to go to the window left open by Legay,
through a superior and resistless power.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE HARBINGER.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> traveler had risen early to look to his coach and learn
how Althotas was faring.</p>

<p>All were still sleeping but Gilbert, who peeped through a window
of his room over the doorway and spied all the stranger's
movements.</p>

<p>The latter was struck by the change which day brought on
the scene so gloomy overnight. The domain of Taverney did
not lack dignity or grace. The old house resembled a cavern
which nature embellishes with flowers, creepers and capricious
rookeries, although at night it would daunt a traveler seeking
shelter.</p>

<p>When Balsamo returned after an hour's stroll to the Red
Castle ruins, he saw the lord of it all leave the house by a
side door to cull roses and crush snails. His slender person
was wrapped in his flowered dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"My lord," said Balsamo, with the more courtesy as he had
been sounding his host's poverty, "allow my excuses with
my respects. I ought to wait your coming down, but the
aspect of Taverney tempted me, and I yearned to view the
imposing ruins and pretty garden."</p>

<p>"The ruins are rather fine," returned the baron; "about
all here worth looking at. The castle was my ancestors'; it
is called the Red Castle, and we long have borne its name
together with Taverney, it being the same barony. Oh, my
lord, as you are a magician," continued the nobleman, "you
ought with a wave of your wand uprear again the old Red
Castle, as well as restore the two thousand odd acres around
it. But I suppose you wanted all your art to make that
beastly bed comfortable. It is my son's, and he growled
enough at it."</p>

<p>"I protest it is excellent, and I want to prove it by doing
you some service in return."</p>

<p>Labrie was bringing to his master a glass of spring water
on a splendid china platter.</p>

<p>"Here's your chance," said the baron, always jeering;
"turn that into wine as the greatest service of all."</p>

<p>Balsamo smiling, the old lord thought it was backing out
and took the glass, swallowing the contents at a gulp.</p>

<p>"Excellent specific," said the mesmerist. "Water is the
noblest of the elements, baron. Nothing resists it; it pierces
stone now, and one of these days will dissolve diamonds."</p>

<p>"It is dissolving me. Will you drink with me. It has
the advantage over wine of running freely here. Not like
my liquor."</p>

<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>

<p>"I might make one useful to you."</p>

<p>"Labrie, a glass of water for the baron. How can the
water which I drink daily comprise properties never suspected
by me? As the fellow in the play talked prose all his
life without knowing it, have I been practising magic for ten
years without an idea of it?"</p>

<p>"I do not know about your lordship, but I do know about
myself," was the other's grave reply.</p>

<p>Taking the glass from Labrie, who had displayed marvelous
celerity, he looked at it steadily.</p>

<p>"What do you see in it, my dear guest?" the baron continued
to mock. "I am dying with eagerness. Come, come!
a windfall to me, another Red Castle to set me on my legs
again."</p>

<p>"I see the advice here to prepare for a visit. A personage
of high distinction is coming, self-invited, conducted by your
son Philip, who is even now near us."</p>

<p>"My dear lord, my son is on military duty at Strasburg,
and he will not be bringing guests at the risk of being punished
as a deserter."</p>

<p>"He is none the less bringing a lady, a mighty dame&mdash;and,
by the way, you had better keep that pretty Abigail of yours
at a distance while she stays, as there is a close likeness between
them."</p>

<p>"The promised lady guest bears a likeness to my servant
Legay? What contradiction!"</p>

<p>"Why not? Once I bought a slave so like Cleopatra that
the Romans talked of palming her off for the genuine queen
in the triumph in their capital."</p>

<p>"So you are at your old tricks again?" laughed the baron.</p>

<p>"How would you like it, were you a princess, for instance,
to see behind your chair a maid who looked your picture, in
short petticoats and linen neckerchief."</p>

<p>"Well, we will protect her against that. But I am very
pleased with this boy of mine who brings guests without forewarning
<a name="tn_png_49"></a><!--TN: Question mark changed to an exclamation mark and quote after "us" on Page 47-->us!"</p>

<p>"I am glad my forecast affords you pleasure, my dear
baron; and, if you meant to properly greet the coming guest,
you have not a minute to lose."</p>

<p>The baron shook his head like the most incredulous of
beings, and as the two were near the dwelling part of the
baron's daughter, he called out to her to impart the stranger's
predictions.</p>

<p>This was the call which brought her to the window despite
herself, and she saw Balsamo. He bowed deeply to her while
fixing his eyes upon her. She reeled and had to catch the
sill not to fall.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, my lord," she answered.</p>

<p>She uttered these words at the very moment when Nicole,<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>
telling the baron that his daughter would not come, stopped
stupefied and with gaping mouth at this capricious contradiction.</p>

<p>Instantly Andrea fell on a chair, all her powers quitting
her. Balsamo had gazed on her to the last.</p>

<p>"This is deusedly hard to believe," remarked the baron,
"and seeing is believing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, see!" said the wonder-worker, pointing up the
avenue, from the end of which came galloping at full speed
a rider whose steed made the stones rattle under its hoofs.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is indeed&mdash;&mdash;" began the baron.</p>

<p>"Master Philip!" screamed Nicole, standing on tiptoe,
while Labrie grunted in pleasure.</p>

<p>"My brother!" cried out Andrea, thrusting her hands
through the window.</p>

<p>"This is the commencement," said Balsamo.</p>

<p>"Decidedly you are a magician," said the baron.</p>

<p>A smile of triumph appeared on the mesmerist's lips.</p>

<p>Soon the horse approached plainly, reeking with sweat and
smoking, and the rider, a young man in an officer's uniform,
splashed with mud up to the countenance, animated by the
speed, leaped off and hurried to embrace his father.</p>

<p>"It is I," said Philip of Taverney, seeing the doubt. "I
bear a great honor for our house. In an hour Marie Antoinette,
Archduchess of Austria and bride of the Dauphin of France,
will be here."</p>

<p>The baron dropped his arms with as much humility as he
had shown sarcasm and irony, and turned to Balsamo for his
forgiveness.</p>

<p>"My lord," said the latter, bowing, "I leave you with your
son, from whom you have been long separated and to whom
you must have a great deal to say."</p>

<p>Saluting Andrea, who rushed to meet her brother in high
delight, Balsamo drew off, beckoning Nicole and Labrie, who
disappeared with him under the trees.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">THE KNIGHT OF REDCASTLE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Philip of Taverney</span>, Knight of Redcastle, did not resemble
his sister, albeit he was as handsome for a man as she
was lovely for a woman.</p>

<p>Andrea's embrace of him was accompanied by sobs revealing
all the importance of this union to her chaste heart. He took
her hand and his father's, and led them into the parlor, where
he sat by their sides.</p>

<p>"You are incredulous, father, and you, sister, surprised.
But nothing can be more true than that this illustrious
princess will be here shortly. You know that the Archduchess<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
made her entry into our realm at Strasburg? As we did not
know the exact hour of her arrival, the troops were under
arms early, and I was sent out to scout. When I came up
with the royal party, the lady herself put her head out of the
coach window, and hailed me. My fatigue vanished as by
enchantment. The dauphiness is young like you, dear, and
beautiful as the angels."</p>

<p>"Tell me, you enthusiast," interrupted the baron, "does
she resemble any one you have seen here before?"</p>

<p>"No one could resemble her&mdash;stay, come to think of it&mdash;why,
Nicole has a faint likeness&mdash;but what led you to suggest that?"</p>

<p>"I had it from a magician, who at the same time foretold
your coming."</p>

<p>"The guest?" timidly inquired Andrea.</p>

<p>"Is he the stranger who discreetly withdrew when I
arrived?"</p>

<p>"The same; but continue your story, Philip."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we had better make something ready," hinted the
lady.</p>

<p>"No," said her father, staying her; "the more we do, the
more ridiculous we shall appear."</p>

<p>"I returned to the city with the news, and all the military
marched to receive the new princess. She listened absently
to the governor's speech and said suddenly: 'What is the
name of this young gentleman who was sent to meet me?'
And her governess wrote on her tablets my name, Chevalier
Philip Taverney Redcastle. 'Sir,' she said, 'if you have no
repugnance to accompany me to Paris, your superior will
oblige me by relieving you of your military duties here, for I
made a vow to attach to my service the first French gentleman
met by me in setting foot in France; and to make him happy,
and his family the same, in case princes have the power to do
so.'"</p>

<p>"What delightful words!" said Andrea, rubbing her
hands.</p>

<p>"Hence, I rode at the princess's coach door to Nancy,
through which we marched by torchlight. She called me to
her to say that she meant to stop a while at Taverney, though
I said our house was not fit to receive so mighty a <a name="tn_png_51b"></a><!--TN: Double Quote removed after "princess." on Page 49.-->princess.</p>

<p>"<a name="tn_png_51"></a><!--TN: Single Quote added before "The" on Page 49.-->'The sweeter will be the welcome, then, the more plain
but the more <a name="tn_png_51a"></a><!--TN: Double quote changed to a single quote after "cordial," on Page 49.-->cordial,' she replied. 'Poor though Taverney
may be, it can supply a bowl of milk to the friend who wishes
to forget for a time that she is the Princess of Austria and
the Bride of France.' Respect prevented me debating further.
So I have ridden ahead."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Andrea; "however kind the princess
may be, she would never be content with a glass of milk and
a bunch of flowers."</p>

<p>"And if she were," went on Taverney, "she would not<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
tolerate my chairs which break one's back, and my ragged
tapestry offending the sight. Devil take capricious women!
France will be prettily governed by a featherbrain, who has
such whims. Plague take such a token of a singular reign!"</p>

<p>"Oh, father! how can you talk so of a princess who floods
our house with favors?"</p>

<p>"Who dishonors me!" returned the old noble. "Who
was thinking about Taverney?&mdash;not a soul. My name slept
under Redcastle ruins not to come forth till I arranged the fit
time; and here comes the freak of a royal babe to pull us out
into public, dusty, tattered and beggarly. The newspapers,
always on the lookout for food for fun, will make a pretty
comic talk of the brilliant princess's visit to the Taverney
hovel. But, death of my life! an idea strikes me. I know
history, and of the Count of Medina setting fire to his palace
to win a queen's attention. I will burn down my kennel for
a bonfire to the Dauphin's bride."</p>

<p>As nimble as though twenty once more, the old peer ran
into the kitchen and plucking a brand, hurried out and over
to the barn, but as he was nearing the trusses of forage, Balsamo
sprang forth and clutched his arm.</p>

<p>"What are you about, my lord?" he asked, wrenching
away the flambeau. "The Archduchess of Austria is no
Constable of Bourbon, a traitor, whose presence so fouls a
dwelling that it must be purified by fire."</p>

<p>The old noble paused, pale and trembling and not smiling
as usual.</p>

<p>"Go and change your gown, my lord, for something more
seemly," continued the mysterious guest. "When I knew
the Baron of Taverney at Philipsburg Siege, he wore the
Grand Cross of St. Louis. I know not of any suit that does
not become rich and stylish under the ribbon of that order.
Take it coolly: her highness will be kept so busy that she will
not notice whether your house be new or old, dull or dazzling.
Be hospitable, as a noble is bound to be. Never forestall vexations,
my lord. Every dog has his day."</p>

<p>Taverney obeyed with the resignation he had previously
shown and went to join his children, who were hunting for
him, uneasy at his absence. The magician silently retired
like one engaged in a piece of work.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">MARIE ANTOINETTE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">As</span> Balsamo had warned them, there was no time to lose.
On the high road, commonly so peaceful, resounded a great
tumult of coaches, horses and voices.</p>

<p>Three carriages stopped at the door, held open by Gilbert,
whose distended eyes and feverish tremor denoted the sharpest<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>
emotion at so much magnificence. The principal coach,
loaded with gilding and mythological carvings, was no less
mud-spattered and dusty than the others.</p>

<p>A score of brilliant young noblemen ranked themselves
near this coach, out of which was assisted a girl of sixteen by
a gentleman clad in black, with the grand sash of the St.
Louis order under his coat. She wore no hair powder, but
this plainness had not prevented the hairdresser building up
her tresses a foot above her forehead.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette Josepha, for it was she, brought into
France a fame for beauty not always owned by princesses destined
to share the throne of that realm. Without being fine,
her eyes took any expression she liked; but particularly those
so opposite as mildness and scorn; her nose was well shaped;
her upper lip pretty; but the lower one, the aristocratic inheritance
of seventeen kaisers, too thick and protruding, even
drooping, did not suit the pretty visage, except when it wanted
to show ire or indignation.</p>

<p>On this occasion, Marie Antoinette wore her womanly look
and womanly smile, more, that of a happy woman. If possible,
she did not mean to be the royal princess till the following
day. The sweetest calm reigned on her face; the most
charming kindness enlivened her eyes.</p>

<p>She was robed in white silk, and her handsome bare arms
supported a heavy lace mantle.</p>

<p>She refused the arm of the gentleman in black, and freely
advanced, snuffing the air, and casting glances around as
though wishful to enjoy brief liberty.</p>

<p>"Oh, the lovely site! What fine old trees! and the pretty
little house!" she ejaculated. "How happy they must dwell
in this nice air and under these trees which hide us in so
well."</p>

<p>Philip Taverney appeared, followed by Andrea, giving her
arm to her father, wearing a fine royal blue velvet coat, last
vestige of former splendor. Andrea wore a ruddy gray silk
dress and had her hair in long plaits. Following Balsamo's
hint, the baron had donned the insignia of the Knightly Order.</p>

<p>"Your highness," said Philip, pale with emotion and noble
in his sorrow, "allow me the honor to present Baron de
Taverney, Red Castle, my sire, and Mademoiselle Claire Andrea,
my sister."</p>

<p>The old noble bowed low with the style of one who knew how
queens should be saluted; his daughter displayed all the grace
of elegant timidity, and the most flattering politeness of sincere
respect.</p>

<p>Regarding the pair, and recalling what Philip had stated on
their poverty, Marie Antoinette felt with them in their suffering.</p>

<p>"Your highness does Taverney Castle too much honor," said<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>
the baron; "so humble a place is nowise worthy to harbor
such beauty and nobility."</p>

<p>"I know that I am at the doors of an old soldier of France,"
was the royal response, "and my mother, the Empress Maria
Theresa, who often went to the wars, says that in your kingdom
the richest in glory are oft the poorest in gold."</p>

<p>With ineffable grace she held out her hand to Andrea, who
knelt to kiss it.</p>

<p>The dauphiness suddenly extricated the baron from his
terror about harboring the great number of the retinue.</p>

<p>"My lords and gentlemen," she said, "it is not for you to
bear the fatigue of my whims or enjoy the privileges of a
royal princess. Pray, await me here; in half an hour I shall
return. Come with me, Langenshausen," she said to the
countess of that house who was her duenna. "Follow me,
my lord," she added to the gentleman in black.</p>

<p>His plain attire was of remarkable style; he was a handsome
person of thirty years and smooth manners; he stood aside
to let the princess go by. She took Andrea to her side and
motioned Philip to follow. The baron fell into place next the
fashionable gentleman.</p>

<p>"So you are a Taverney of Redcastle?" queried this fop, as
he preened his fine honiton lace ruffles with aristocratic impertinence.</p>

<p>"Am I to answer a gentleman or a nobleman?" returned
the baron with equal sauciness.</p>

<p>"Prince will do," said the other, "or eminence."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, your eminence, I am a real Taverney," replied
the poor nobleman, without dropping the insolent tone
he usually kept.</p>

<p>The prince had the tact of great lords, for he readily perceived
that he was not dealing with a rustic hobbledehoy.</p>

<p>"I suppose this is your summer residence?" he continued.</p>

<p>"My residence in all seasons," replied the baron, desiring
to finish with this examination, but accompanying his answers
with deep bows.</p>

<p>Philip kept turning round to his father with uneasiness;
the house seemed towering up to exhibit more and more of
their penury. The baron was just holding his hand toward
the sill, deserted by visitors, when the dauphiness turned to
him, saying:</p>

<p>"Excuse me not going indoors, but these shady spots are so
pleasant that I could pass my life beneath them. I am rather
weary of interiors. For a fortnight I have been received
under roofs&mdash;and I like open air, flowers and the shade of
foliage. Might I not have a drink of milk in this bower?"</p>

<p>"What a mean refreshment, your highness!" faltered the
baron.</p>

<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>

<p>"I prefer it, with new-laid eggs, my lord. Such formed my
feasts at Schoenbrunn."</p>

<p>All of a sudden, Labrie, puffed up with pride in a showy
livery, and holding a damask napkin, appeared in the
jessamine hung arbor which the archduchess was eyeing covetously.</p>

<p>"The refreshment is ready for your royal highness," he
said with a neat mingling of respect and serenity.</p>

<p>"Am I housed by an enchanter?" exclaimed the princess,
darting into the bower.</p>

<p>The perturbed baron forgot etiquette to leave the gentleman
in black and run after his guest.</p>

<p>Philip and Andrea looked at each other with even more
anxiety than astonishment.</p>

<p>Under the twining clematis, jessamine and honeysuckle an
oval table was set, dazzling from the whiteness of the damask
cloth and the carved bullion plate upon it. Ten sets of silver
awaited as many guests. A choice but strange collation attracted
the visitor's gaze. Foreign fruit preserved in sugar; cake and
crackers from Aleppo and Madeira, oranges and melons of uncommon
size, set in large vases. The richest and noblest
wines glittered in all hues of ruby and topaz in four cut-glass
Persian decanters. The milk asked for filled a crystal
cup.</p>

<p>"But you must have expected me, since in no ten minutes
which I have been here could this sumptuous spread be
placed." And the princess glanced at Labrie as much as to
say: "With only one servant, too?"</p>

<p>"I did expect your royal highness," faltered the baron;
"of your coming being apprised."</p>

<p>"If your son did not inform you by letter, then it must
have been some fairy&mdash;I suppose, the godmother of your
daughter."</p>

<p>"It was not so much a fairy, as a magician," said Taverney,
offering a seat to the princess. "I do not know anything
about how he has done this, as I do not dabble in magic, but
I owe it to him that I am fitly entertaining your highness."</p>

<p>"Then I will have none of it. It is contrary to the faith&mdash;but
his eminence is going to sin, with that liver-pie!"</p>

<p>"We are rather too worldly, we princes of the Church,"
replied the gentleman in black, "to believe the celestial
wrath poisons victuals, and we are too human to visit ill on
magicians who provide such good things."</p>

<p>"But I assure your eminence that this is a real sorcerer
who conjured up this board ready spread, and who may
have produced the gold of this service in the same manner."</p>

<p>"Does he know of the stone which changes all into gold?"
questioned the churchman, with his eyes kindling with covetousness.</p>

<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>

<p>"This pleases the cardinal, who has passed his life seeking
the philosopher's stone," said the princess.</p>

<p>"I own that I find nothing more interesting than supernatural
things," returned the prince; "nothing more curious
than what's impossible."</p>

<p>"So I have hit the vital spot, have I?" said the archduchess.
"Every great man has a mystery, <a name="tn_png_56"></a><!--TN: "particulary" changed to "particularly" on Page 54-->particularly when he is a
diplomatist. Let me warn your eminence that I also am a
witch, and that I can see into matters&mdash;if not curious and impossible&mdash;incredible."</p>

<p>This was an incomprehensible enigma to all but the cardinal,
for he was plainly embarrassed. The gentle eye of the
Austrian had flared with one of those fires denoting a storm
gathering. But there was no thunderous outbreak, for she
went on, restraining herself:</p>

<p>"Come my lord of Taverney, make the feast complete by
producing your magician. Where is he? In what box have
you put Old Hocus Pocus?"</p>

<p>"Labrie, notify Baron Joseph Balsamo that her Royal
Highness the Dauphiness desires to see him."</p>

<p>"Balsamo?" repeated the high lady, as the valet started off.
"What an odd name!"</p>

<p>"I fancy I have heard it before," murmured the cardinal.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed with none thinking of breaking the
stillness, when Andrea shuddered, for she heard before any
other the step beneath the foliage. The branches were parted
and right in front of Marie Antoinette, Joseph Balsamo appeared.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">A MARVEL OF MAGIC.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Humble</span> was Balsamo's bow; but immediately raising his
intelligent and expressive brow, he fixed his clear eye, though
with respect, on the chief guest, silently waiting for her to
question him.</p>

<p>"If you are the person Baron Taverney has mentioned,
pray draw nigh that we may see what a magician is like."</p>

<p>Balsamo came a step nearer and bowed to Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>"So you make a business of foretelling?" said the latter,
sipping the milk while regarding the new comer with more
curiosity than she liked to betray.</p>

<p>"I make no business of it, but I do foretell, please your
royal highness?" was the answer.</p>

<p>"Educated in an enlightened faith, we place faith solely in
the mysteries of our religion."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly they are worthy of veneration," responded
the other dialoguist with a profound congé. "But the<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>
Cardinal de Rohan here, though Prince of the Church, will
tell you that they are not the only ones worthy of respect."</p>

<p>The cardinal started, for his title had not been announced.</p>

<p>Not appearing to notice this revelation, Marie Antoinette
pursued:</p>

<p>"But you must allow that they alone cannot be controverted."</p>

<p>"There can be fact as well as faith," replied Balsamo, with
the same respect but with the same firmness.</p>

<p>"You speak a trifle darkly, my lord Baron of Magic. I am
at heart a good Frenchwoman, but not in mind, and do not
yet understand all the fineness of the language. They say I
shall soon pick it up, even to the puns. Meanwhile, I must
urge you to speak more plainly if you want my comprehension."</p>

<p>"I ask your highness to let me dwell obscure," said the
baron, with a melancholy smile. "I should feel too much
regret to reveal to so great a princess a future not equal to her
hopes."</p>

<p>"Dear me, this is becoming serious," said Marie Antoinette,
"and Abracadabra whets my curiosity in order to make me
beg my fortune to be told."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid my being forced into it," observed Balsamo
<a name="tn_png_57"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "coldly." on Page 55-->coldly.</p>

<p>"Of course, for you would be put to much pains for little
result," laughed the princess.</p>

<p>But her merriment died away without a courtier's echoing
it; all suffered the influence of the mystic man who claimed
the whole attention.</p>

<p>"Still it was you foretold my coming to Taverney?" said
the mighty lady, to which Balsamo silently bowed. "How
was the trick done, my lord baron?"</p>

<p>"Simply by looking into a glass of water, my liege lady,"
was the old noble's answer.</p>

<p>"If that be truly your magic mirror, it is guileless at any
rate; may your words be as clear!"</p>

<p>The cardinal smiled, and the master of the place said:</p>

<p>"Your highness will not have to take lessons in punning."</p>

<p>"Nay, my dear host, do not flatter me, or flatter me better.
It seems to me it was a mild quip; but, my lord," she resumed,
turning toward Balsamo by that irresistible attraction drawing
us to a danger, "if you can read the future in a glass
for a gentleman, may you not read it for a lady in a
decanter?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; but the future is uncertain, and I should
shrink from saddening your royal highness if a cloud veiled
it, as I have already had the honor to say."</p>

<p>"Do you know me beforetimes? Where did you first see
me?"</p>

<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>

<p>"I saw you as a child beside your august mother, that
mighty queen."</p>

<p>"Empress, my lord."</p>

<p>"Queen by heart and mind, but such have weaknesses when
they think they act for their daughters' happiness."</p>

<p>"I hope history will not record one single weakness in
Maria Theresa," retorted the other.</p>

<p>"Because it does not know what is known solely to your
highness, her mother and myself."</p>

<p>"Is there a secret among us three?" sneered the lady. "I
must hear it."</p>

<p>"In Schoenbrunn Palace is the Saxony Cabinet, where the
empress sits in private. One morning, about seven, the empress
not being up, your highness entered this study, and perceived
a letter of hers, open, on the writing-table."</p>

<p>The hearer blushed.</p>

<p>"Reading it, your highness took up a pen and struck out
the three words beginning it."</p>

<p>"Speak them aloud!"</p>

<p>"'My dear Friend.'"</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette bit her lips as she turned pale.</p>

<p>"Am I to tell to whom the letter was addressed?" inquired
the seer.</p>

<p>"No, no, but you may write it."</p>

<p>The soothsayer took out his memorandum book fastening
with a gilt clasp, and with a kind of pencil from which flowed
ink, wrote on a leaf. Detaching this page, he presented it to
the princess, who read:</p>

<p>"The letter was addressed to the marchioness of Pompadour,
mistress of King Louis XV."</p>

<p>The dauphiness' astounded look rose upon this clearly
speaking man, with pure and steady voice, who appeared to
tower over her although he bowed lowly.</p>

<p>"All this is quite true," she admitted, "and though I am
unaware how you could learn this secret, I am bound to allow,
before all, that you speak true."</p>

<p>"Then I may retire upon this innocent proof of my
science."</p>

<p>"Not so, my lord baron," said the princess, nettled; "the
wiser you are, the more I long for your forecast. You have
only spoken of the past, and I demand the future."</p>

<p>Her feverish agitation could not escape the bystanders.</p>

<p>"Let me at least consult the oracle, to learn whether the
prediction may be revealed."</p>

<p>"Good or bad, I must hear it!" cried Marie Antoinette with
growing irritation. "I shall not believe it if good, taking it
for flattery; but bad, I shall regard it as a warning, and I promise
any way not to bear you ill will. Begin your witchcraft."</p>

<p>Balsamo took up the decanter with a broad mouth and<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>
stood it in a golden saucer. He raised it thus high up, and,
after looking at it shook his head.</p>

<p>"I cannot speak. Some things must not be told to princes,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Because you have nothing to say?" and she smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>Balsamo appeared embarrassed, so that the cardinal began
to laugh in his face and the baron grumbled.</p>

<p>"My wizard is worn out," he said. "Nothing is to follow
but the gold turning into dry leaves, as in the Arabian tale."</p>

<p>"I would have preferred the leaves to all this show; for
there is no shame in drinking from a nobleman's pewter goblet,
while a dauphiness of France ought not to have to use the
thimble-rigging cup of a charlatan."</p>

<p>Balsamo started erect as if a viper had bitten him.</p>

<p>"Your highness shall know your fate, since your blindness
drives you to it."</p>

<p>These words were uttered in a voice so steady but so threatening
that the hearers felt icy chills in their veins. The lady
turned pale visibly.</p>

<p>"Do not listen to him, my daughter," whispered the old
governess in German to her ward.</p>

<p>"Let her hear, for since she wanted to know, know she
shall!" said Balsamo in the same language, which doubled the
mystery over the incident. "But to you alone, lady."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said the latter. "Stand back!"</p>

<p>"I suppose this is just an artifice to get a private audience?"
sneered she, turning again to the magician.</p>

<p>"Do not try to irritate me," said he; "I am but the instrument
of a higher Power, used to enlighten you. Insult
fate and it will revenge itself, well knowing how. I merely
interpret its moves. Do not fling at me the wrath which will
recoil on yourself, for you can not visit on me the woes of
which I am the sinister herald."</p>

<p>"Then there are woes?" said the princess, softened by his
respectfulness and disarmed by his apparent resignation.</p>

<p>"Very great ones."</p>

<p>"Tell me all. First, will my family live happy?"</p>

<p>"Your misfortunes will not reach those you leave at home.
They are personal to you and your new family. This royal
family has three members, the Duke of Berry, the Count of
Provence, and the Count of Artois. They will all three
reign."</p>

<p>"Am I to have no son?"</p>

<p>"Sons will be among your offspring, but you will deplore
that one should live and the other die."</p>

<p>"Will not my husband love me?"</p>

<p>"Too well. But his love and your family's support will
fail you."</p>

<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>

<p>"Those of the people will yet be mine."</p>

<p>"Popular love and support&mdash;the ocean in a calm. Have
you seen it in a storm?"</p>

<p>"I will prevent it rising, or ride upon the billows."</p>

<p>"The higher its crest, the deeper the abyss."</p>

<p>"Heaven remains to me."</p>

<p>"Heaven does not save the heads it dooms."</p>

<p>"My head in danger? Shall I not reign a queen?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but would to God you never did."</p>

<p>The princess smiled disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Hearken, and remember," proceeded Balsamo. "Did you
remark the subject on the tapestry of the first room you
entered on French ground? The Massacre of the Innocents;
the ominous figures must have remained in your mind.
During that storm, did you see that the lightning felled a tree
on your left, almost to crush your coach? Such presages are
not to be interpreted but as fatal ones."</p>

<p>Letting her head fall upon her bosom, the princess reflected
for a space before asking:</p>

<p>"How will those three die?"</p>

<p>"Your husband the king will die headless; Count Provence,
legless; and Artois heartless."</p>

<p>"But myself? I command you to speak, or I shall hold all
this as a paltry trick. Take care, my lord, for the daughter
of Maria Theresa is not to be sported with&mdash;a woman who
holds in hand the destinies of thirty millions of souls. You
know no more, or your imagination is exhausted."</p>

<p>Balsamo placed the saucer and the decanter on a bench in
the darkest nook of the arbor, which thus resembled a
pythoness' cave; he led her within the gloom.</p>

<p>"Down on your knees," he said, alarming her by the
action; "for you will seem to be imploring God to spare you
the terrible outcome which you are to view."</p>

<p>Mechanically the princess obeyed, but as Balsamo touched
the crystal with his magic wand, some frightful picture no
doubt appeared in it, for the princess tried to rise, reeled,
and screamed as she fell in a swoon.</p>

<p>They ran to her.</p>

<p>"That decanter?" she cried, when revived.</p>

<p>The water was limpid and stainless.</p>

<p>The wonder-worker had disappeared!</p>

<span class="chapterhead">TAVERNEY'S PROSPECTS BRIGHTEN.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> first to perceive the archduchess's fainting fit, was
Baron Taverney who was on the lookout from being most uneasy
about the interview. Hearing the scream and seeing
Balsamo dart out of the bower he ran up.</p>

<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>

<p>The first word of the dauphiness was to call for the bewitched
decanter: her second to bid no harm to be done
the sorcerer. It was time to say it, for Philip Taverney had
rushed after the latter.</p>

<p>She attributed the swoon to fever from the journey. She
talked of sleeping for some hours, in Andrea's room, but the
Governor of Strasburg arrived in hot haste with a dispatch
from Versailles, and she had to receive Lord Stainville, who
was brother in-law of the prime minister.</p>

<p>Opening this missive, the princess read:</p>

<p>"The court presentation of Lady Dubarry is fixed on, if she
can find a patroness, which we hope will not be. But the
surest method of blocking the project is to have your royal
highness here, in whose presence none will dare suggest such
an offense."</p>

<p>"Very good. My horses must be put to. We depart at
once."</p>

<p>Cardinal Rohan looked at Lord Stainville as if for an explanation
of this abrupt change.</p>

<p>"The dauphin is in a hurry to see his wife," whispered the
latter with such cunning that the churchman thought it had
slipped his tongue and was satisfied with it.</p>

<p>Andrea had been trained by her father to understand royal
freaks; she was not surprised at the contradiction. So the
lady saw only smoothness on her face as she turned to her,
saying:</p>

<p>"Thank you; your welcome has deeply touched me. Baron,
you are aware that I made the vow to benefit the first French
gentleman and his family, whom I should meet on the
frontier. But I am not going to stop at this point, and Mademoiselle
Andrea is not to be forgotten. Yes, I wish her to
be my maid of honor. The brother will defend the king in
the army, the sister will serve me; the father will instruct the
first in loyalty, the other in virtue. I shall have enviable
servitors, do you not agree?" she continued to Philip, who
was kneeling. "I will leave one of my carriages to bring you
in my train. Governor, name somebody to accompany my
carriage for the Taverneys, and notify that it is of my household."</p>

<p>"Beausire," called out the governor, "come forward."</p>

<p>A sharp-eyed cavalier, some twenty-four years old, rode out
from the escort and saluted.</p>

<p>"Set a guard over Baron Taverney's coach, and escort it."</p>

<p>"We shall meet soon again, then," said the princess with a
smile. "Let us be off, my lords and gentlemen."</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour, all remaining of the whirling
cavalcade was the carriage left in the avenue and the guardsman
whose horse was cropping the dandelions.</p>

<p>"Where is the magician?" inquired Taverney.</p>

<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>

<p>"Gone, too, my lord."</p>

<p>"I never heard of the like&mdash;leaving all that valuable plate."</p>

<p>"He left a note which Gilbert is fretting to deliver."</p>

<p>"Father," said Andrea, "I know what is tormenting you.
You know I have thirty gold pieces, and the diamond-set
watch Queen Maria Leczinska gave my mother."</p>

<p>"That is well," said the baron, <a name="tn_png_62"></a><!--TN: Quote added before "but" on Page 60-->"but keep it, though we must
hunt up means for a handsome robe for your court presentation.
Hush! here is Labrie."</p>

<p>"The note, my lord, which was given Gilbert by the
strange gentleman."</p>

<p>The baron snatched it from the servant and read in an
undertone:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord:</span> Since an august hand touched this service of plate
under your roof, it belongs to your lordship, and I pray you
to keep it as a memento, and sometimes to remember, your
grateful guest, <span class="smcap alignright">Balsamo."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>"Labrie, is there a good goldsmith at Bar-le-Duc?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, the one who mended our young lady's
jewelry."</p>

<p>"Put aside the cup the princess used, and pack up the rest
of the plate in our carriage. And then, haste to the cellar
and serve that officer with all the liquor left. Come, come,
Andrea, courage! We are going to court, a splendid place
where the sun never fails. You are naturally lovely and
have only to set the gem becomingly to outshine them all."</p>

<p>Nicole followed Andrea to her room.</p>

<p>"I am off to arrange my titles of nobility and proofs of
service," continued the baron, trotting to his room briskly.
"We shall be off from this den in an hour; do you hear, Andrea?
And we leave by the golden gates, too. What a
trump that magician is! Really, I have become as superstitious
as the devil's own. But make haste, Labrie!" he cried
to his man groping about in the cellar.</p>

<p>"I can't get on faster, master&mdash;we have not a candle left."</p>

<p>"It is plain that we are getting out in the right time,"
thought the baron.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">NICOLE'S DOWER.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Nicole</span> aided her young mistress in her traveling preparations
with ardor which speedily dissipated the cloud risen that
morning between maid and mistress. The latter smiled as
she found that she would have no need to scold her.</p>

<p>"She is a good, devoted girl and grateful," she mused;
"only she has weaknesses, like all womankind. Let us forget."</p>

<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>

<p>On her part, Nicole was not the girl not to watch her mistress'
face, and she saw the kindliness increasing.</p>

<p>"I was a fool nearly to get into a scrape with her for that
rascal Gilbert, when she is going to town, where everybody
makes a fortune."</p>

<p>"Put my lace in my box. Stop! I gave you that box, I
remember; and you will want it, as you are going to set up
housekeeping."</p>

<p>"Oh, my lady," said Nicole, reddening, and replying
merrily, "my wedding garments will be easily kept in no
great space."</p>

<p>"How so? I want you to be well off when you wed."</p>

<p>"Have you found me a rich match?"</p>

<p>"No, but a dower of twenty-five gold pieces."</p>

<p>"You would give me such a treasure!" Emotion followed
her surprise, and tears gushed into her eyes as she
kissed Andrea's hand.</p>

<p>Nicole began to think that Gilbert had rejected her from
fear of poverty, and that now she had funds, she had better
marry the ambitious spark to whom she would appear more desirable.
But a germ of pride mingled with the generosity,
as she wanted to humble one who had jilted her.</p>

<p>"It looks as though you really loved your Gilbert," observed
the lady. "How incredible for something in the lad to please
you. I must have a look at this lady-killer next time I see
him."</p>

<p>Nicole eyed her with lingering doubt. Was this deep
hypocrisy or perfect ignorance?</p>

<p>"Is Gilbert coming to Paris with us?" she inquired, to be
settled on the point.</p>

<p>"What for? he is not a domestic and is not fitted for a Parisian
establishment. The loungers about Taverney are like the
birds which can pick up a living on their own ground; but in
Paris a hanger-on would cost too much, and we cannot tolerate
that. If you marry him, you must stay here. I give you an
hour to decide between my household or your husband's. I
detest these connubial details and will not have a married
servant. In any case, here is the money; marry, and have it
as dower; follow me, and it is your first two years' wages, in
advance."</p>

<p>Nicole took the purse from her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>The lady watched her go away and muttered: "She is
happy, for she loves."</p>

<p>Nicole in five minutes was at the window of Gilbert's room,
at the back of which he was turning over his things.</p>

<p>"I have come to tell you that my mistress wants me to go
with her to Paris."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the young man.</p>

<p>"Unless I get married and settled here."</p>

<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>

<p>"Are you thinking still of that?" he asked, without any
feeling.</p>

<p>"Particularly, since I am rich from my lady dowering me,"
and she showed the bright <a name="tn_png_11"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "gord" on Page 62-->gold.</p>

<p>"A pretty sum," he said drily.</p>

<p>"That is not all. My lord is going to be rich. He will
rebuild the castle, and the house will have to be guarded&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the happy mate of Nicole," suggested Gilbert with
irony, not sufficiently wrapped up not to wound the girl,
though she contained herself. "I refuse the offer, for I am
not going to bury myself here when Paris is open to me
also. Paris is my stage, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"And mine, and I understand you. You may not regret
me; but you will fear me, and blush to see to what you drive
me. I longed to be an honest woman, but, when I was leaning
over the verge, you repulsed me instead of pulling me
back. I am slipping and I shall fall, and heaven will ask you
to account for the loss. Farewell, Gilbert!"</p>

<p>The proud girl spun round without anger now, or impatience,
having exhausted all her generosity of soul.</p>

<p>Gilbert quietly closed the window and resumed the mysterious
business which Nicole's coming had interrupted.</p>

<p>She returned to her mistress with a deliberate air.</p>

<p>"I shall not marry," she said.</p>

<p>"But your great love?"</p>

<p>"It is not worth the kindness your ladyship has done me.
I belong to you and shall ever so belong. I know the mistress
which heaven gave me; but I might never know the master
whom I give myself."</p>

<p>Andrea was touched by this display of emotion, which she
was far from expecting in the maid. She was of course ignorant
that Nicole was making her a pillow to fall back upon.
She smiled to believe a human creature was better than she
estimated.</p>

<p>"You are doing right," she said. "If bliss befalls me, you
shall have your share. But did you settle with your sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"I told him that I would have no more to do with him."</p>

<p>She was restored to her former suspicions, and it was fated
that the two should never understand each other&mdash;one with
her diamond purity and the other with her tendency to evil.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the baron had packed up his scanty valuables,
and Labrie shouldered the half-empty trunk, containing them,
to accompany his master out to where the corporal of guards
was finishing the wine to the last drop.</p>

<p>This soldier gallant had remarked the fine waist and pretty
limbs of Nicole, and he was prowling round the pool to see
her again. He was drawn from his reverie by the baron calling
for his carriage. Saluting him, he called in a ringing<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>
voice for the driver to come up the avenue. Labrie put the
trunk on the rack behind with unspeakable pride and delight.</p>

<p>"I am going to ride in the royal coaches," he muttered.</p>

<p>"But up behind, my old boy," corrected Beausire, with a
patronizing smile.</p>

<p>"Who is to keep Taverney if you take Labrie, father?" inquired
Andrea.</p>

<p>"That lazy philosopher, Gilbert; with his gun he will have
ample to eat, I warrant, for there is plenty of game at
Taverney."</p>

<p>Andrea looked at Nicole, who laughed and added:</p>

<p>"He is a sly dog; he will not starve."</p>

<p>"Leave him a trifle," suggested Andrea.</p>

<p>"It will spoil him. He is bad enough now. If he wants
anything we will send him help."</p>

<p>"He would not accept money, my lord."</p>

<p>"Your Gilbert must be pretty proud, then?"</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, he is no longer my Gilbert!"</p>

<p>"Deuse take Gilbert, whoever's property he is," said Taverney,
to cut short what annoyed his selfishness. "The coach
is stopping the way; get in, daughter."</p>

<p>Andrea gave the house a farewell glance and stepped into
the vehicle. The baron installed himself next her; Labrie in
his glorious livery and Nicole got upon the box, for the driver
turned himself into a postillion and bestrode one of the horses.</p>

<p>"But the corporal?" queried the baron.</p>

<p>"I ride my charger," responded Beausire, ogling Nicole,
who colored up with pleasure at having so soon replaced the
rustic lad with a stylish cavalier.</p>

<p>Gilbert stood with his hat off at the gate, and, without seeming
to see, looked on Andrea alone. She was bending out of
the opposite window to watch the house to the last.</p>

<p>"Stop a bit," ordered Baron Taverney; "hark you, master
idler," he said to Gilbert, "you ought to be a happy dog to
be left by yourself, as suits a true philosopher, with nobody
to bother you or upbraid you. Don't let the house catch afire
while you brood, and take care of the watchdog. Go ahead,
coachman!"</p>

<p>Gilbert slammed the gates, groaning for want of oil, and
ran back to his little room, where he had his little bundle
ready. It also contained his savings in a silver piece.</p>

<p>Mahon was howling when he came out, and straining at his
chain.</p>

<p>"Am I not cast off like a dog? why should not a dog be
cast off like a man? No, you shall at least be free to seek
your livelihood like myself."</p>

<p>The liberated dog ran round the house, but finding all the
doors closed, he bounded the ruins.</p>

<p>"Now we are going to see who fares the better&mdash;man or<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>
dog," said Gilbert. "Farewell, mansion where I have suffered
and where all despised me! where bread was cast to me with
the reproach that I was stealing it by making no return.
Farewell&mdash;no, curses on you! My heart leaps with joy at no
longer being jailed up in your walls. Forever be accursed,
prison, hell, lair of tyrants!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE OUTCAST'S LUCK.</span></h2>

<p><span class="firstwords">But</span> in his long journey to Paris he had often to regret this
abode which he had cursed. Sore, wearied, famished&mdash;for he
had lost his coin&mdash;he fell in the dusty highway, but with
clenched fists and eyes glaring with rage.</p>

<p>"Out of the way, there!" yelled a hoarse voice, amid cracking
of a whip.</p>

<p>He did not hear, for his senses left him. He remained before
the hoofs of the horses, drawing a postchaise up a side
road between Vauclere and Thieblemont, which he had not
perceived.</p>

<p>A scream pealed from inside the carriage, which the horses
were whirling along like a feather on the gale. The postboy
made a superhuman effort and managed to keep his horses
from trampling on the boy, though one of the leaders gave
him a kick.</p>

<p>"Good God!" screamed a woman again; "you have crushed
the unhappy child."</p>

<p>The lady traveler got out, and the postillion alighted to lift
Gilbert's body from under the wheel.</p>

<p>"What luck!" said the man; "dashed if he be hurted&mdash;only
swooned."</p>

<p>"With fright, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I'll drag him to the roadside, and let us go on, since your
ladyship is in hot haste."</p>

<p>"I cannot possibly leave this poor boy in such a plight. So
young, poor little thing! It is some truant scholar undertaking
a journey beyond his powers. How pale he is&mdash;he
will die. No, no! I will not abandon him. Put him inside,
on the front seat."</p>

<p>The postboy obeyed the lady, who had already got in the
berlin, as were called such carriages. Gilbert was put on a
good cushion with his back supported by the padded sides.</p>

<p>"Away you go again," said the lady. "Ten minutes lost,
for which you must make up, while I will pay you the more."</p>

<p>When Gilbert came to his senses he found himself in the
coach, swept along by three posthorses. He was not a little
surprised, too, to be almost in the <a name="tn_png_66"></a><!--TN: "of" added after "lap" on Page 64-->lap of a young woman who
attentively studied him.</p>

<p>She was not more than twenty-five. She had cheeks<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>
scorched by the southern sun, with a turn-up nose and gray
eyes. A clear character of cunning and circumspection was
given to her open and jovial countenance by the little mouth
of delicate and fanciful design. Her arms, the finest in the
world, were molded in violet velvet sleeves adorned with gilt
buttons. Nearly the whole vehicle was filled up by the wavy
folds of her large flower-patterned gray silk dress.</p>

<p>As the countenance was smiling and expressed interest, Gilbert
stared for fear he was in a dream.</p>

<p>"Well, are you better, my little man?" asked she.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" counter-queried Gilbert, who had learned
this phrase from novels, where alone it is used.</p>

<p>"In safety, my dear little fellow," replied the lady in a
southern accent. "A while ago you ran great risk of being
smashed under my carriage wheels. What happened you, to
drop on the highroad right in the middle?"</p>

<p>"I swooned from having walked some eighteen leagues
since four yesterday afternoon, or, rather, run."</p>

<p>"Whither are you bound?"</p>

<p>"To Versailles, lady. I come from Taverney, a castle between
Pierrefitte and Bar-le-Duc."</p>

<p>"Did you not give yourself time to eat?"</p>

<p>"I had neither the time nor the means, for I lost a bit of
money, and I soon ate the crusts I carried."</p>

<p>"Poor boy! but you might have asked for more bread."</p>

<p>"I am too proud, lady," said Gilbert, smiling loftily.</p>

<p>"Pride is all very well, but not when it lets one die of hunger."</p>

<p>"Death before disgrace!"</p>

<p>"Hello! where did you learn such talk?"</p>

<p>"Not at home, for I am an orphan. My name is Gilbert,
and no more."</p>

<p>"Some by-blow of a country squire," thought the woman.
"You are very young to roam the highway," she continued.</p>

<p>"I was not roaming," said the youth, who thought the
truth would recommend him to a woman. "I was following
a carriage."</p>

<p>"With your lady love in it? Dear me! there is a romance
in your adventure?"</p>

<p>Gilbert was not enough his own master not to redden.</p>

<p>"What was the carriage, my little Cato?"</p>

<p>"One of the dauphiness' retinue."</p>

<p>"What, is she ahead of us?" exclaimed the woman. "Are
they not making a fuss over her along the route?"</p>

<p>"They wanted to, but she pressed on after having talked of
staying for rest at Taverney Castle, for a letter came from Versailles,
they said, and she was off in three-quarters of an hour."</p>

<p>"A letter?"</p>

<p>"Brought by the Governor of Strasburg."</p>

<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>

<p>"Lord Stainville? Duke Choiseul's brother? The mischief!
Whip on, postillion! faster, faster!"</p>

<p>The whip snapped and Gilbert felt the vehicle jump with
more velocity.</p>

<p>"We may outstrip her if she stops for breakfast, or at
night," meditated the woman. "Postillion, which is the next
town of any account?"</p>

<p>"Vitry."</p>

<p>"Where do we change horses?"</p>

<p>"Vauclere."</p>

<p>"Go on; but tell me if you see a string of carriages on the
main road. Poor child!" she continued, seeing how pale Gilbert
was; "it is my fault for making him chatter when he is
dying of hunger and thirst."</p>

<p>To make up for the lost time, she took out a traveling flask
with a silver cap as stopper, into which she poured a
cordial.</p>

<p>"Drink that and eat a cake," she said, "until you can have
a substantial breakfast in an hour or two. Now, as you are a
whit refreshed, tell me, if you have any trust in me, what
interest you have in following the carriage belonging to the
dauphiness' train?"</p>

<p>He related his story with much clearness.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," she said. "I congratulate you. But you
must know that one cannot live on courage at Versailles or
Paris."</p>

<p>"But one can by toil."</p>

<p>"That's so. But you have not the hands of a craftsman or
laborer."</p>

<p>"I will work with my head."</p>

<p>"Yes, you appear rather knowing."</p>

<p>"I know I am ignorant," said Gilbert, recalling Socrates.</p>

<p>"You will make a good doctor, then, since a doctor is one
who administers drugs of which he knows little into a body
of which he knows less. In ten years I promise you my custom."</p>

<p>"I shall try to deserve the honor, lady," replied Gilbert.</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_68"></a><!--TN: Quote removed before "The" on Page 66-->The horses were changed without their having overtaken
the royal party, which had stopped for the same and to
breakfast at Vitry. The lady offered bounteously for the
distance between to be covered, but the postillion dared not
outstrip the princess&mdash;a crime for which he would be sent to
prison for life.</p>

<p>"If I might suggest," observed Gilbert, "you could cut
ahead by a by-road."</p>

<p>The vehicle therefore turned off to the right and came out
on the main road at Chalons. The princess had breakfasted at
Vitry, but was so tired that she was reposing, having ordered
the horses to be ready to start again at three or four <span class="smaller">P. M.<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
This so delighted the lady traveler that she paid the postboy
lavishly and said to Gilbert:</p>

<p>"We shall have a feast at the next posting house."</p>

<p>But it was decreed that Gilbert should not dine there.</p>

<p>The change of horses was to be at Chaussee village. The
most remarkable object here was a man who stood in the mid-road,
as if on duty there. He looked along it and on a long-tailed
barb which was hitched to a window shutter and neighed
fretfully for its master to come out of the cottage.</p>

<p>At length the man knocked on the shutter, and called.</p>

<p>"I say, sir," he demanded of the man who showed his head at
the window, "if you want to sell that horse, here is the
customer."</p>

<p>"Not for sale," replied the peasant, banging the shutter to.</p>

<p>This did not satisfy the stranger, who was a lusty man of
forty, tall and ruddy, with coarse hands in lace ruffles. He
wore a laced cocked hat crosswise, like soldiers who want to
scare rustics.</p>

<p>"You are not polite," he said, hammering on the shutter.
"If you do not open, I shall smash in the blind."</p>

<p>The panel opened at this menace and the clown reappeared.</p>

<p>"Who does this Arab belong to?"</p>

<p>"A lady lodging here, who is very fond of it."</p>

<p>"Let me speak with her."</p>

<p>"Can't; she is sleeping."</p>

<p>"Ask her if she wants five hundred pistoles for the barb."</p>

<p>"That is a right royal price." And the rustic opened his
eyes widely.</p>

<p>"Just, so; the king wants the creature."</p>

<p>"You are not the king."</p>

<p>"But I represent him, and he is in a hurry."</p>

<p>"I must not wake her."</p>

<p>"Then I shall!" and he swung up a cane with a gold head
in his herculean fist.</p>

<p>But he lowered it without hitting, for at the same instant
he caught sight of a carriage tearing up the slope behind
three fagged horses. The skilled eye of the would-be buyer
recognized the vehicle, for he rushed toward it with a speed
the Arabian might have envied.</p>

<p>It was the post carriage of Gilbert's guardian angel, which
the postboy was enchanted to stop, on seeing the man wave
him to do so, for he knew the nags would never reach the
post house.</p>

<p>"Chon, my dear Chon," said the stranger. "What joy
that you turn up, at last!"</p>

<p>"It is I, Jean," replied the lady to whom was given this
odd name; "what are you doing <a name="tn_png_69"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "here?" on Page 67-->here?"</p>

<p>"A pretty question, by Jove! I was waiting for you."</p>

<p>The Hercules stepped on the folding-step, and kissed the<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>
lady through the window. Suddenly he caught sight of Gilbert,
and turned as black as a dog from which is snatched a
bone, from not knowing the terms between the pair in the
berlin.</p>

<p>"It is a most amusing little philosopher whom I picked
up," returned Chon, caring little whether she wounded the
pet's feelings or not, "on the road&mdash;but never mind him."</p>

<p>"Another matter indeed worries us. What about the old
Countess of Bearn?" asked Jean.</p>

<p>"I have done the job, and she will come. I said I was her
lawyer's daughter, Mademoiselle Flageot, and that, passing
through Verdun, I repeated from my father that her case
was coming on. I added that she must appear in person,
whereupon she opened her gray eyes, took a pinch of snuff,
and saying Lawyer Flageot was the first of business men,
she gave orders for her departure."</p>

<p>"Splendid, Chon! I appoint you my ambassador extraordinary.
Come and have breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Only too glad, for this poor boy is dying of hunger.
But we must make haste, for the dauphiness is only three
leagues off."</p>

<p>"Plague! that changes the tune. <a name="tn_png_70"></a><!--TN: Quote removed before "Go" on Page 68-->Go on to the posting
house, with me hanging on as I am."</p>

<p>In five minutes the coach was at the inn door, where Chon
ordered cutlets, fowl, wine and eggs, as they had to be off
forthwith.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, lady, but it will have to be with your own
horses, for all mine are out. If you find one at the manger,
I will eat it."</p>

<p>"You ought to have some, for the regulations require it.
Let me tell you," thundered Jean with a hectoring air, "I
am not the man to jest."</p>

<p>"If I had fifty in the stable it would be the same as none,
for they are all held on the dauphiness' service."</p>

<p>"Fifty, and you would not let us have three?" said Jean;
"I do not ask for eight, to which number royal highnesses are
entitled, but three."</p>

<p>"You shall not have one," returned the post master, springing
in between the stables and the obstinate gentleman.</p>

<p>"Blunderhead, do you know who I am?" cried the other,
pale with rage.</p>

<p>"Viscount," interposed Chon, "in heaven's name, no
disorder."</p>

<p>"You are right, my dear; no more words; only deeds."
He turned to the innkeeper, saying, "I shall shield you from
responsibility by taking three horses myself."</p>

<p>"It must not be done, I tell 'ee."</p>

<p>"Do not help him harness," said the posting house keeper
to the grooms.</p>

<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>

<p>"Jean," said Chon, "don't get into a scrape. On an errand
one must put up with anything."</p>

<p>"Except delay," replied Viscount Jean with the utmost
ease.</p>

<p>And he began taking down three sets of harness, which
he threw on three horses' backs.</p>

<p>"Mind, master," said the post master, as he followed Jean,
leading the horses out to the coach, "this is high treason."</p>

<p>"I am not stealing the royal horses but taking them on
loan."</p>

<p>The innkeeper rushed at the reins but the strong man sent
him spinning.</p>

<p>"Brother, oh, brother!" screamed Chon.</p>

<p>"Only her brother!" muttered Gilbert.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">TAVERNEY TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">At</span> this period a window in the cottage opened and a lovely
woman's face appeared, above the Arabian courser, the uproar
having aroused her.</p>

<p>"The very person wanted," cried Jean. "Fair lady, I
offer you five hundred pistoles for your horse."</p>

<p>"My horse?" questioned the lady in bad French.</p>

<p>"Yes, the barb hitched there."</p>

<p>"Not for sale," and the lady slammed the window.</p>

<p>"Come, come, I am not in luck this day," said Jean, "for
folk will neither sell nor hire. Confound it all! I shall take
the Arab, if not for sale, and the coach horses if not for hire,
and run them to their last legs. Put the horses to," he
concluded to the lady traveler's lackey, who was on the
coach.</p>

<p>"Help me, boys?" shouted the post master to his hostlers.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't," cried Chon to her brother; "you will only be
massacred."</p>

<p>"Massacred, with three to three? for I count on your
philosopher," said Jean, shouting to Gilbert, who was stupefied.
"Get out and pitch in with a cane, or a rock, or the fist. And
don't look like a plaster image!"</p>

<p>Here the burlesque battle began, with the horses pulled between
Jean and their owner. The stronger man hurled the
latter into the duckpond, where he floundered among the
frightened ducks and geese.</p>

<p>"Help! murder!" he shrieked, while the viscount hastened
to get the fresh horses into the traces.</p>

<p>"Help, in the king's name!" yelled the innkeeper, rallying
his two grooms.</p>

<p>"Who claims help in the royal name?" challenged a horse<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>man
who suddenly galloped into the inn yard and pulled up
his reeking steed amid the fighting party.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Philip de Taverney!" exclaimed Gilbert, sinking
back deeper than ever in the carriage corner.</p>

<p>Chon, who let nothing slip her, caught this name.</p>

<p>The young officer of the dauphin's dragoon guards leaped
off his horse amid the scene, which was attracting all the villagers.
The innkeeper ran up to him imploringly as the
saver.</p>

<p>"Officer, this gentleman is trying to take away the horses
kept for her Royal Highness," he faltered.</p>

<p>"Gentleman?" queried Philip.</p>

<p>"Yes, this gentleman;" retorted <a name="tn_png_72"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "Jean" on Page 70-->Jean.</p>

<p>"You mistake, you are mad&mdash;or no gentleman," replied the
Chevalier of Redcastle.</p>

<p>"My dear lieutenant, you are wrong on both points," said
the viscount; "I have my senses, and I am entitled to ride in
the royal carriages."</p>

<p>"How dare you, then, lay hands on the horses for the
royal princess?"</p>

<p>"Because there are fifty here and the <i>Royals</i> are entitled
to but eight. Am I to go afoot when lackeys have four nags
to draw them?"</p>

<p>"If it is the order of his Majesty, they may have what they
like. So be good enough to make your fellow take back those
horses."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you are on duty to guard them, lieutenant," replied
Jean; "but I did not know that the dauphiness' dragoons
were set to guard grooms. Better shut your eyes, tell
your squad to do the same, and I wish you a pleasant
journey!"</p>

<p>"You are wrong, sir; I am on duty, as the dauphiness has
sent me forward to look after the relays."</p>

<p>"That is different. But allow the remark that you are on
paltry duty, and the young Bonnibel is shamefully treating
the army&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of whom are you speaking in such terms?" interrupted
Philip.</p>

<p>"Oh, only of that Austrian beauty."</p>

<p>Taverney turned pale as his cravat, but in his usual calm
voice he said, as he caught hold of the bridle:</p>

<p>"Do me the pleasure to acquaint me with your name?"</p>

<p>"If you are bent upon that&mdash;I am Viscount Jean Dubarry."</p>

<p>"What, brother of that notorious&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who will send you to rot in the Bastille prison, if you
add a word to the adjective."</p>

<p>The viscount sprang into the coach, up to the door of which
went the baron's son.</p>

<p>"If you do not come forth in a second I give you my<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
word of honor that I shall run my sword through your
body."</p>

<p>Having hold of the door with his left hand, pulling against
the viscount, he drew his sword with the other.</p>

<p>"The idea!" said Chon; "this is murder. Give up the
horses, Jean."</p>

<p>"Oh, you threaten me, do you?" hissed the viscount, exasperated,
and snatching his sword from the cushion.</p>

<p>"We shall never get away at this rate," whispered Chon;
"do smooth the officer down."</p>

<p>"Neither violence nor gentleness will stay me in my duty,"
observed Taverney, politely bowing to the young woman.
"Advise obedience to the gentleman, or in the name of the
king, whom I represent, I shall kill him if he will fight me,
or arrest him if he refuses."</p>

<p>"Shall I lug him out, lieutenant?" asked the corporal, who
had Taverney's half-dozen men as escort.</p>

<p>"No, this is a personal quarrel," said his superior. "You
need not interfere."</p>

<p>There was truly no need; for, after three minutes, Jean
Dubarry drew back from the conflict with Redcastle, his
sleeve dyed with blood.</p>

<p>"Go, sir," said the victor, "and do not play such pranks
any more."</p>

<p>"Tush, I pay for them," grumbled the viscount.</p>

<p>Luckily three horses came in which would do for the
change, and the innkeeper was only too glad to get rid of the
turbulent viscount at their price. As he mounted the carriage
steps, he grumbled at Gilbert's being in the way.</p>

<p>"Hush, brother," said Chon; "he knows the man who
wounded you. He is Philip of Taverney."</p>

<p>"Then we shall be even yet," said the viscount, with a
gleam of gladness. "You are on the high horse at present,
my little dragoon," he shouted out to Taverney; "but turn
about is fair play."</p>

<p>"To the return, if you please," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Chevalier Philip de Taverney!" called Jean, watching
for the effect of the sudden declaration of his name.</p>

<p>Indeed, his hearer raised his head with sharp surprise, in
which entered some unease, but recovering himself and lifting
his hat, he rejoined with the utmost grace:</p>

<p>"A pleasant journey, Chevalier Jean Dubarry!"</p>

<p>"A thousand thunders," swore the viscount, grinning horribly
as the coach started. "I am in acute pain, Chon, and
shall want a surgeon sooner than breakfast."</p>

<p>"We will get one at the first stop while this youth has his
meal."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Gilbert, as the invalid expressed a desire
to drink. "But strong drink is bad for you at present."</p>

<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>

<p>"What, are you a doctor as well as philosopher?" queried
Jean.</p>

<p>"Not yet, my lord; though I hope to be one some day. But
I read that wounded patients must not take anything heated.
But if you will let me have your handkerchief, I will dip it
in water at the first spring and cool the wound by bandaging
it."</p>

<p>The carriage was stopped for Gilbert to get out and wet the
cambric.</p>

<p>"This youngster is dreadfully in the way for us to talk
business," said Dubarry.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! we will talk in the Southern dialect," said Chon;
and it was thanks to this precaution that the two <a name="tn_png_74"></a><!--TN: "comm" (blotted word) changed to "communed" on Page 72-->communed
to the puzzlement of the youth on the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>But he had the consolation of thinking that he had comforted
a viscount who stood in the king's favor. If Andrea
only saw him now! He did not think of Nicole.</p>

<p>"Hello!" broke off the viscount, as he looked behind out
of the window. "Here comes that Arab with the strange woman
on its back. I would give a thousand pistoles for that
steed, and a fortune for the beauty."</p>

<p>The black-eyed woman wrapped in a white cloak, with her
brow shaded by a broad-brimmed felt hat with long feathers,
flew by like an arrow along the roadside, crying:</p>

<p>"<i>Avanti</i>, Djerid!"</p>

<p>"She says 'Forward!' in Italian," said the viscount. "Oh,
the lovely creature. If I were not in such pain, I would jump
out and after her."</p>

<p>"You could not catch her, on that horse. It is the magician,
and she is his wife."</p>

<p>"Magician?" questioned the Dubarrys together.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baron Joseph Balsamo."</p>

<p>The sister looked at the brother as much as to say: "Was
I not right to keep him?" and he nodded emphatically.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE KING'S FAVORITE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">In</span> the apartments of Princess Adelaide, daughter of King
Louis X., he had housed the Countess Jeanne Dubarry, his
favorite since a year, not without studying the effect it would
have on the realm. The jolly, mirthful, devil-may-care mad-cap
had transformed the silent palace into a monkey-house,
where any one was tolerated who kept the fun alive.</p>

<p>At about nine in the morning, the hour of her reception,
Jeanne Vaubernier, to give her her true name, stepped out of
her couch, wrapped in an embroidered gauze gown which
allowed a glimpse through the floating lace of her alabaster
arms. This seductive statue, awakening more and more, drew<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>
a lace mantle over her shoulders and held out her little foot
for a slipper which, with its jewels, would enrich a woodcutter
in her native woods had he found it.</p>

<p>"Any news of Chon, or the Viscount Jean?" she asked at
once of her chambermaid.</p>

<p>"None, and no letters, my lady."</p>

<p>"What a bore to be kept waiting!" pouted the royal pet,
with a pretty wry face. "Will they never invent a method of
corresponding a hundred miles apart? Faith, I pity anybody
I visit with my vexation this day. But I suppose that, as this
star the dauphiness is coming, I, the poor glowworm, will be
left alone. Who is waiting, tell me?"</p>

<p>"Duke Daiguillon, Prince Soubise, Count Sartines and
President Maupeou."</p>

<p>"But the Duke of Richelieu?"</p>

<p>"He has not yet come."</p>

<p>"No more than yesterday. That political weathercock has
turned from me. He is afraid to be injured, Doris. You
must send to his house to ask after him."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady; but the king is here."</p>

<p>"Very well; I am ready."</p>

<p>The Fifteenth Louis entered the room with a smile on his
lips and his head upright. He was accompanied solely by a
gentleman in black, who tried by a smile to counteract the
baleful effect of thin, hard lips and severe gray eyes. It was
Lieutenant of Police Sartines.</p>

<p>The waiting maid and a little negro boy were in the room;
but they were not counted.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, countess," hailed the monarch; "how
fresh we are looking to-day. Don't be afraid of Sartines; he
is not going to talk business, I trust. Oh, how magnificent
Zamore is looking!"</p>

<p>The blackamoor was appareled with the barbaric splendor
in which Othello was attired at that period.</p>

<p>"Sire, he has a favor to crave of your Majesty."</p>

<p>"He seems to me very ambitious, after having been
granted by you the greatest boon one can desire&mdash;being your
slave, like myself."</p>

<p>Sartines bowed, smiling, but bit his lips at the same time.</p>

<p>"How delightful you are, sire," said the countess. "I
adore you, France!" she whispered in the royal ear, and set
him smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you desire for Zamore?"</p>

<p>"Recompense for his long service&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is only twelve years old!"</p>

<p>"You will be paying him in advance; that is a good way of
not being treated with ingratitude."</p>

<p>"Capital idea! What do you think, Sartines?" asked the
king.</p>

<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>

<p>"I support it, as all devoted subjects will gain by it."</p>

<p>"Well, sire, I want Zamore to be appointed governor of
my summer residence, Luciennes, which shall be created a
royal place."</p>

<p>"It would be a parody and make all the governors of the
royal places protest, and with reason."</p>

<p>"A good thing, for they are always making a noise for
nothing. Zamore, kneel down and thank his majesty for the
favor. Sire, you have another royal property from this time
forward. Get up, Zamore. You are appointed."</p>

<p>"Sartines, do you know the way to refuse this witch anything?"</p>

<p>"If there is one, it is not yet out into practice, sire."</p>

<p>"When found, I wager it will be by Chief of Police Sartines.
I am expecting him to find me something&mdash;and I have
been on thorns about it for three months. I want a
magician."</p>

<p>"To have him burnt <a name="tn_png_76"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "alive?" on Page 74-->alive?" asked the sovereign, while Sartines
breathed again. "It is warm weather, now; wait for
winter."</p>

<p>"Not to burn him, but to give him a golden rod, sire."</p>

<p>"Oh, did he predict some ill which has not happened?"</p>

<p>"Nay, a blessing which came to pass."</p>

<p>"Tell us, countess," said Louis, settling down in an easy
chair, like one who is not sure he will be pleased or oppressed
but will risk it.</p>

<p>"I am agreeable, sire, only you must share in rewarding
him."</p>

<p>"I must make the present entirely."</p>

<p>"That is right royal."</p>

<p>"I listen."</p>

<p>"It begins like a fairy tale. Once upon a time, a poor girl
was walking the streets of Paris, what time she had neither
pages, carriages, negro boy to hold up her train and enrage
the dowagers, or parrot or monkey. Crossing the Tuileries
gardens, she suddenly perceived that she was pursued."</p>

<p>"Deuce take it! thereupon she stopped," said the king.</p>

<p>"Fie! It is clear that your experience has been in following
duchesses or marchionesses. She was the more alarmed
as a thick fog came on, and the chaser emerged from it upon
her. She screamed."</p>

<p>"For the rogue was ugly?"</p>

<p>"No, he was a bright and handsome young man; but still
she sued him to spare her from harm. He smiled charmingly
and called heaven as witness that he had no such intention.
He only wanted her pledge to grant him a favor when&mdash;when
she should be a queen. She thought she was not binding
herself much with such a promise, and the man disappeared."</p>

<p>"Sartines is very wrong in not finding him."</p>

<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>

<p>"Sire, I do not refuse, but I cannot."</p>

<p>"Cannot ought not to be in the police dictionary," said
Dubarry.</p>

<p>"We have a clew."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! that is the old story."</p>

<p>"It is the truth. The fault is that your description is so
slight."</p>

<p>"Slight? she painted him so brightly that I forbid you to
find the dog."</p>

<p>"I only want to ask a piece of information."</p>

<p>"What for, when his prophecy is accomplished?"</p>

<p>"If I am almost a queen, I want to ask him when I shall
be placed in the court."</p>

<p>"Presented formally?"</p>

<p>"It is not enough to reign in the night; I want to reign a
little in the daytime."</p>

<p>"That is not the magician's business, but mine," said Louis,
frowning at the conversation getting upon delicate ground.
"Or rather yours, for all that is wanted is an introductress."</p>

<p>"Among the court prudes&mdash;all sold to Choiseul or Praslin?"</p>

<p>"Pray let us have no politics here."</p>

<p>"If I am not to speak, I shall act without speaking, and
upset the ministers without any further notice."</p>

<p>At this juncture the maid Doris entered and spoke a word
to her mistress.</p>

<p>"It is Chon, who comes from traveling and begs to present
her respects to your majesty."</p>

<p>"Let us have Chon in, for I have missed something lately,
and it may be her."</p>

<p>"I thank your majesty," said Chon, coming in, and hastening
to whisper to her sister in kissing her:</p>

<p>"I have done it."</p>

<p>The countess could not repress an outcry of delight.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see her."</p>

<p>"Quite so; go on and chat with her while I confer with
Sartines to learn whence you come, Chon."</p>

<p>"Sire," said Sartines, eager to avoid the pinch, "may I have
a moment for the most important matter?&mdash;about these seers,
illuminati, miracle workers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quacks? make them take out licenses as conjurers at a
high figure, and they will not be any cause of fear."</p>

<p>"Sire, the situation is more serious than most believe. New
masonic lodges are being opened. This society has become a
sect to which is affiliated all the foes of the monarchy, the
idealists, encyclopedists and philosophers. Voltaire has been
received at court."</p>

<p>"A dying man."</p>

<p>"Only his pretense. All are agitating, writing, speaking,<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>
corresponding, plotting and threatening. From some words
dropped, they are expecting a leader."</p>

<p>"When he turns up, Sartines, we will turn him down, in
the Bastille."</p>

<p>"These philosophers whom you despise will destroy the
monarchy."</p>

<p>"In what space of time, my lord?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" said the chief of police, looking astonished.
"Ten, fifteen or more years."</p>

<p>"My dear friend, in that time I shall be no more; tell this
to my successor."</p>

<p>He turned away, and this was the opportunity that the
favorite was waiting for, since she heaved a sigh, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, gracious, Chon, what are you telling me? My poor
brother Jean so badly wounded that his arm will have to be
amputated!"</p>

<p>"Oh, wounded in some street affray or in a drinking-saloon
quarrel?"</p>

<p>"No, sire! attacked on the king's highway and nearly
murdered."</p>

<p>"Murdered?" repeated the ruler, who had no feelings, but
could finely feign them. "This is in your province, Sartines."</p>

<p>"Can such a thing have happened?" said the chief of
police, apparently less concerned than the king, but in reality
more so.</p>

<p>"I saw a man spring on my brother," said Chon, "force
him to draw his sword and cut him grievously."</p>

<p>"Was the ruffian alone?"</p>

<p>"He had half a dozen bullies with him."</p>

<p>"Poor viscount forced to fight," sighed the monarch, trying
to regulate the amount of his grief by the countess'; but
he saw that she was not pretending.</p>

<p>"And wounded?" he went on, in a heartbroken tone.</p>

<p>"But what was the scuffle about?" asked the police lieutenant,
trying to see into the affair.</p>

<p>"Most frivolous; about posthorses, disputed for with the
viscount, who was in a hurry to help me home to my sister,
whom I had promised to join this morning."</p>

<p>"This requires retaliation, eh, Sartines?" said the king.</p>

<p>"It looks so, but I will inquire into it. The aggressor's
name and rank?"</p>

<p>"I believe he is a military officer, in the dauphiness'
dragoon guards, and named something like Baverne, or
Faver&mdash;stop&mdash;it is Taverney."</p>

<p>"To-morrow he will sleep in prison," said the chief of police.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," interrupted the countess out of deep silence;
"that is not likely, for he is but an instrument and you will<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>
not punish the real instigators of the outrage. It is the work
of the Duke of Choiseul. I shall leave the field free for my
foes, and quit a realm where the ruler is daunted by his ministers."</p>

<p>"How dare you?" cried Louis, offended.</p>

<p>Chon understood that her sister was going too far, and she
struck in.</p>

<p>She plucked her sister by the dress and said:</p>

<p>"Sire, my sister's love for our poor brother carries her
away. I committed the fault and I must repair it. As the
most humble subject of your majesty, I merely apply for
justice."</p>

<p>"That is good; I only ask to deal justice. If the man has
done wrong, let him be <a name="tn_png_79"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period added after "chastised" on Page 77-->chastised."</p>

<p>"Am I asking anything else?" said the countess, glancing
pityingly at the monarch, who was so worried elsewhere and
seldom tormented in her rooms. "But I do not like my
suspicions snubbed."</p>

<p>"Your suspicions shall be changed to certainty by a very
simple course. We will have the Duke of Choiseul here.
We will confront the parties at odds, as the lawyers say."</p>

<p>At this moment the usher opened the door and announced
that the prince royal was waiting in the king's apartments
to see him.</p>

<p>"It is written I shall have no peace," grumbled Louis.
But he was not sorry to avoid the wrangle with Choiseul, and
he brightened up. "I am going, countess. Farewell! you see
how miserable I am with everybody pulling me about. Ah,
if the philosophers only knew what a dog's life a king has&mdash;especially
when he is king of France."</p>

<p>"But what am I say to the Duke of Choiseul?"</p>

<p>"Send him to me, countess."</p>

<p>Kissing her hand, trembling with fury, he hastened away as
usual, fearing every time to lose the fruit of a battle won by
palliatives and common cunning.</p>

<p>"Alas! he escapes us again!" wailed the courtesan, clenching
her plump hands in vexation.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">A ROYAL CLOCK-REPAIRER.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">In</span> the Hall of the Clocks, in Versailles Palace, a pink-cheeked
and meek-eyed young gentleman was walking about
with a somewhat vulgar step. His arms were pendent and
his head sunk forward. He was in his seventeenth year.
He was recognizable as the king's heir by being the living
image of the Bourbon race, most exaggerated. Louis
Auguste, Duke of Berry and heir to the throne as the dauphin,
soon wearied of his lounge and stopped to gaze with the air of<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>
one who understood horology, on the great clock in the
back of the hall. It was a universal machine, which told of
time to the century, with the lunar phases and the courses of
the planets, and was always the prince's admiration.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hands on which his eyes were fastened came
to a standstill. A grain of sand had checked the mechanism,
and the master-piece was dead.</p>

<p>On seeing this misfortune, the royal one forgot what he
had come to do. He opened the clock-case glazed door, and
put his head inside to see what was the matter. All at once
he uttered a cry of joy, for he had spied a screw loose, of which
the head had worked up and caught another part of the
machinery. With a tortoise shell pick in one hand, and
holding the wheel with the other, he began to fix the screw,
with his head in the box. Thus absorbed he never heard the
usher at the door, cry out: "The king!"</p>

<p>Louis was some time glancing about before he spied the
prince's legs as he stood half eclipsed before the clock.</p>

<p>"What the deuse are you doing there?" he asked, as he
tapped his son on the shoulder.</p>

<p>The amateur clockmaker drew himself out with the proper
precautions for so noble a timepiece.</p>

<p>"Oh, your majesty, I was just <i>killing time</i> while you were
not present."</p>

<p>"By murdering my clock! Pretty amusement!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, only setting it to rights. A screw was loose
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind mechanics! What do you want of me? I am
eager to be off to Marly."</p>

<p>He started for the door, always trying to avoid awkward
situations.</p>

<p>"Is it money you are after? I will send you some."</p>

<p>"Nay, I have savings out of my last quarter's money."</p>

<p>"What a miser, and yet a spendthrift was his tutor! I believe
he has all the virtues missing in me."</p>

<p>"Sire, is not the bride near at hand yet?"</p>

<p>"Your bride? I should say fifty leagues off. Are you in a
hurry."</p>

<p>The prince royal blushed.</p>

<p>"I am not eager for the motive you think."</p>

<p>"No? So much the worse. Hang it all! You are sixteen
and the princess very pretty. You are warranted in being
impatient."</p>

<p>"Cannot the ceremonies be curtailed, for at this rate she will
be an age coming. I don't think the traveling arrangements
are well made."</p>

<p>"The mischief! thirty thousand horses placed along the
route, with men and carts and coaches&mdash;how can you believe<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>
there is bad management when I have made all these arrangements?"</p>

<p>"Sire, in spite of these, I am bound to say that I think, as
in the case of your clock, there is a screw loose. The progress
has been right royally arranged, but did your majesty make
it fully understood that all the horses, men and vehicles were
to be employed by the dauphiness?"</p>

<p>A vague suspicion annoyed the monarch, who looked hard
at his heir; this suggestion agreed with another idea fretting
him.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied. "Of course you are satisfied,
then? The bride will arrive on time, and she is properly attended
to. You are rich with your savings, and you can wind
up my clock and set it going again. I have a good mind to
appoint you Clockmaker Extraordinary to the Royal Household,
do you hear?" and, laughing, he was going to snatch
the opportunity to slip away, when, as he opened the door, he
faced a man on the sill.</p>

<p>Louis drew back a step.</p>

<p>"Choiseul!" he exclaimed. "I had forgotten she was to send
him to me. Never mind, he shall pay for my son irritating
me. So you have come, my lord? You heard I wanted you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sire," replied the prime minister, coldly. "I was
dressing to come, any way."</p>

<p>"Good; I have serious matters to discuss," said the sovereign,
frowning to intimidate the minister, who was, unfortunately,
the hardest man to browbeat in the kingdom.</p>

<p>"Very serious matters I have to discuss, too," he replied,
with a glance for the dauphin, who was skulking behind the
clock.</p>

<p>"Oho!" thought the king; "my son is my foe, too. I am
in a triangle with woman, minister and son, and cannot
escape."</p>

<p>"I come to say that the Viscount Jean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was nearly murdered in an ambush?"</p>

<p>"Nay, that he was wounded in the forearm in a duel. I
know it perfectly."</p>

<p>"So do I, and I will tell you the true story."</p>

<p>"We listen," responded Choiseul. "For the prince is concerned
in the affray, so far as it was on account of the
dauphiness."</p>

<p>"The dauphiness and Jean Dubarry in some way connected?"
questioned the king. "This is getting curious.
Pray explain, my lord, and conceal nothing. Was it the
princess who gave the swordthrust to Dubarry?"</p>

<p>"Not her highness, but one of the officers of her escort,"
replied Choiseul, as calm as ever.</p>

<p>"One whom you know?"</p>

<p>"No, sire; but your majesty ought to know him, if your<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>
majesty remembers all his old servants; for his father fought
for you at Fontenoy, Philipsburg and Mahon&mdash;he is a Taverney
Redcastle."</p>

<p>The dauphin mutely repeated the title to engrave it on his
mind.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I know the Redcastles," returned Louis. "Why
did he fight against Jean, whom I like&mdash;unless because I like
him? Absurd jealousy, outbreaks of discontent, and partial
sedition!"</p>

<p>"Does the defender of the royal princess deserve this reproach?"
said the duke.</p>

<p>"I must say," said the prince, rising erect and folding his
arms, "I am grateful to the young gentleman who risked his
life for a lady who will shortly be my wife."</p>

<p>"What did he risk his life for?" queried the king.</p>

<p>"Because the Chevalier Jean in a hurry wanted to take the
horses set aside by your majesty for the royal bride."</p>

<p>The king bit his lips and changed color, for the new way of
presenting the case was again a menacing phantom.</p>

<p>"Yes, Chevalier Dubarry was putting the insult on the
royal house of taking the reserved royal horses, when up
came the Chevalier Redcastle, sent onward by her highness,
and after much civil remonstrance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" protested the king. "Civil&mdash;a military man?"</p>

<p>"It was so," interposed the dauphin. "I have been fully
informed. Dubarry whipped out his sword&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was he the first to draw?" demanded the king.</p>

<p>The prince blushed and looked to Choiseul for support.</p>

<p>"The fact is, the two crossed swords," the latter hastened
to say, "one having insulted the lady, the other defending
her and your majesty's property."</p>

<p>"But who was the aggressor, for Jean is mild as a lamb,"
said the monarch, glad that things were getting equalized.</p>

<p>"The officer must have been malapert."</p>

<p>"Impertinent to a man who was dragging away the horses
reserved for your majesty's destined daughter?" exclaimed
Choiseul. "Is this possible?"</p>

<p>"Hasty, anyway," said the king, as the dauphin stood
pale without a word.</p>

<p>"A zealous servitor can never do wrong," remarked the
duke, receding a step.</p>

<p>"Come, now, how did you get the news?" asked the king
of his son, without losing sight of the minister, who was
troubled by this abrupt question.</p>

<p>"I had an advice from one who was offended by the insult to
the lady of my choice."</p>

<p>"Secret correspondence, eh?" exclaimed the sovereign.
"Plots, plots! Here you are, beginning to worry me again,
as in the days of Pompadour."</p>

<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>

<p>"No, this is only a secondary matter. Let the culprit be
punished, and that will end the affair."</p>

<p>At the suggestion of punishment, Louis saw Jeanne furious
and Chon up in arms.</p>

<p>"Punish, without hearing the case?" he said. "I have
signed quite enough blank committals to jail. A pretty mess
you are dragging me into, duke."</p>

<p>"But what a scandal, if the first outrage to the princess is
allowed to go unpunished, sire."</p>

<p>"I entreat your majesty," said the dauphin.</p>

<p>"What, don't you think the sword cut was enough punishment?"</p>

<p>"No, sire, for he might have wounded Lieutenant Taverney.
In that case I should have asked for his head."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the dauphin, "I only ask for his banishment."</p>

<p>"Exile, for an alehouse scuffle," said the king. "In spite
of your philosophical notions, you are harsh, Louis. It is
true that you are a mathematician, and such are hard as&mdash;well,
they would sacrifice the world to have their ciphering
come out correct."</p>

<p>"Sire, I am not angry with Chevalier Dubarry personally,
but as he insulted the dauphiness."</p>

<p>"What a model husband!" sneered the king. "But I am
not to be gulled in this way. I see that I am attacked under
all these blinds. It is odd that you cannot let me live in my
own way, but must hate all whom I like, and like all I dislike!
Am I mad, or sane? Am I the master, or not!"</p>

<p>The prince went back to the clock. Choiseul bowed as
before.</p>

<p>"No answer, eh? Why don't you say something? Do you
want to worry me into the grave with your petty hints and
strange silence, your paltry spites and minute dreads?"</p>

<p>"I do not hate Chevalier Dubarry," said the prince.</p>

<p>"I do not dread him," added Choiseul.</p>

<p>"You are both bad at heart," went on the sovereign, trying
to be furious but only showing spite. "Do you want me
to realize the fable with which my cousin of Prussia jeers me,
that mine is the Court of King Petaud? No, I shall do nothing
of the kind. I stand on my honor in my own style and will
defend it similarly."</p>

<p>"Sire," said the prince with his inexhaustible meekness
but eternal persistency, "your majesty's honor is not affected&mdash;it
is the dignity of the royal princess which is struck at."</p>

<p>"Let Chevalier Jean make excuses, then, as he is free to do.
But he is free to do the other thing."</p>

<p>"I warn your majesty that the affair will be talked of, if
thus dropped," said the prime minister.</p>

<p>"Who cares? Do as I do. Let the public chatter, and heed
them not&mdash;unless you like to laugh at them. I shall be deaf<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>
to all. The sooner they make such a noise as to deafen me,
the sooner I shall cease to hear them. Think over what I say,
for I am sick of this. I am going to Marly, where I can get a
little quiet&mdash;if I am not followed out there. At least, I shall
not meet your sister the Lady Louise there, for she has retired
to the nunnery of St. Denis."</p>

<p>But the dauphin was not listening to this news of the
breaking up of his family.</p>

<p>"It is going," he exclaimed in delight, real or feigned, as
the clock resumed its regular tickings.</p>

<p>The minister frowned and bowed himself out backward from
the hall, where the heir to the throne was left alone.</p>

<p>The king going into his study, paced it with long strides.</p>

<p>"I can clearly see that Choiseul is railing at me. The
prince looks on himself as half the master, and believes he
will be entirely so when he mounts with this Austrian on the
throne. My daughter Louise loves me, but she preaches morality
and she gives me the go-by to live in the nunnery. My
three other girls sing songs against me and poor Jeanne. The
Count of Provence is translating Lucretius. His brother of
Artois is running wild about the streets. Decidedly none but
this poor countess loves me. Devil take those who try to displease
her!"</p>

<p>Sitting at the table where his father signed papers, his
treaties and grandiloquent epistles, the son of the great king
took up the pen.</p>

<p>"I understand why they are all hastening the arrival of the
archduchess. But I am not going to be perturbed by her
sooner than can be helped," and he wrote an order for Governor
Stainville to stop three days at one city and three at another.</p>

<p>With the same pen he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Countess</span>: This day we install Zamore in his new
government. I am off for Marly, but I will come over to
Luciennes this evening to tell you all I am thinking about at
present. <span class="smcap alignright">France."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Lebel," he said to his confidential valet, "away with this
to the countess, and my advice is for you to keep in her good
graces."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE COUNTESS OF BEARN.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">A hackney</span> coach stopping at the doorway of Chancellor
Maupeou, president of Parliament, induced the porter to
deign to stalk out to the door of the vehicle and see why the
way was thus blocked.</p>

<p>He saw an old lady in an antiquated costume. She was<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>
thin and bony but active, with cat's eyes rolling under gray
brows. But poverty stricken though she appeared, the porter
showed respect as he asked her name.</p>

<p>"I am the Countess of Bearn," she replied; "but I fear that
I shall not have the fortune to find his lordship at home."</p>

<p>"My lord is receiving," answered the janitor. "That is, he
will receive your ladyship."</p>

<p>The old lady stepped out of the carriage, wondering if she
did not dream, while the porter gave two jerks to a bellrope.
An usher came to the portals, where the first servant motioned
that the visitor might enter.</p>

<p>"If your ladyship desires speech with the lord high chancellor,"
said the usher, "step this way, please."</p>

<p>"They do speak ill of this official," uttered the lady; "but he
has the good trait that he is easily accessible. But it is strange
that so high an officer of the law should have open doors."</p>

<p>Chancellor Maupeou, buried in an enormous wig and clad
in black velvet, was writing in his study, where the door was
open.</p>

<p>On entering, the old countess threw a rapid glance around,
but to her surprise there was no other face than hers and that
of the law lord, thin, yellow and busy, reflected in the
mirrors.</p>

<p>He rose in one piece and placed himself with his back to the
fireplace.</p>

<p>The lady made the three courtesies according to rule.</p>

<p>Her little compliment was rather unsteady; she had not
expected the honor; she never could have believed that a
cabinet minister would give her some time out of his business
or his repose.</p>

<p>Maupeou replied that time was no less precious to subject
than his majesty's ministers, although preference had to be
given to persons with urgent affairs, consequently, he gave
what leisure he had to such clients.</p>

<p>"My lord," said the old lady, with fresh courtesies, "I beg
most humbly to speak to your excellency of a grave matter on
which depends my fortune. You know that my all depends,
or rather my son's, on the case sustained by me against the
Saluces family. You are a friend of that family, but your
lordship's equity is so well known that I have not hesitated
to apply to you."</p>

<p>The chancellor was fondling his chin, but he could not help
a smile to hear his fair play extolled.</p>

<p>"My lady, you are right in calling me friend of the Saluces;
but I laid aside friendship when I took the seals of office <a name="tn_png_85"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period added after "up" on Page 83-->up.
I look into your business simply as a juris consultus. The
case is soon coming on?"</p>

<p>"In another week I should beg your lordship to look over
my papers."</p>

<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>

<p>"I have done so already."</p>

<p>"Oh! What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I beg to say that you ought to be prepared to go home
and get the money together to pay the costs&mdash;for you will
infallibly lose the case."</p>

<p>"Then my son and I are ruined!"</p>

<p>"Unless you have friends at court to counterbalance the
influence of the Saluces brothers, who are linked with three
parts of the courtiers. In fact, I know not if they have an
enemy."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear your Excellency say this."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say so, for I really wanted to be useful to
your ladyship."</p>

<p>The countess shuddered at the tone of feigned kindness, for
she seemed to catch a glimpse of something dark in the mind,
if not the speech of the chancellor; if that obscurity could be
swept away she fancied she would see something favorable to
her.</p>

<p>"Do you know nobody at court?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Only some old noblemen, probably retired, who would
blush to see their old friend so poor. I have my right of entry
to the palace, but what is the good? Better to have the right
to enter into enjoyment of my two hundred thousand livres.
Work that miracle, my lord."</p>

<p>"Judges cannot be led astray by private influence," he
said, forgetting that he was contradicting himself. "Why
not, however, apply to the new powers, eager to make recruits?
You must have known the royal princesses?"</p>

<p>"They have grown out of remembrance."</p>

<p>"The prince royal?"</p>

<p>"I never knew him."</p>

<p>"Besides, he is dwelling too much on his bride, who is on
the road hither, to do any one a good turn. Oh! why not address
the favorites?"</p>

<p>"The Duke of Choiseul?"</p>

<p>"No, the other, the Countess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dubarry?" said the prude, opening her fan.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is goodhearted and she likes to do kindnesses to
her friends."</p>

<p>"I am of too old a line for her to like me."</p>

<p>"That is where you are wrong; for she is trying to ally
herself with the old families."</p>

<p>"But I have never seen her."</p>

<p>"What a pity! Or her sister, Chon, the other sister
Bischi, her brother Jean, or her negro boy Zamore?"</p>

<p>"What! is her negro a power at court?"</p>

<p>"Indeed he is."</p>

<p>"A black who looks like a pug dog, for they sell his picture<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>
in the streets. How was I to meet this blackamoor, my lord?"
and the dame drew herself up, offended.</p>

<p>"It is a pity you did not, for Zamore would win your suit
for you. Ask the dukes and peers of the realm who take candies
to him at Marly or Luciennes. I am the lord high
chancellor, but what do you think I was about when your
ladyship called? Drawing up the instructions for him as
governor of Luciennes, to which Zamore has been appointed."</p>

<p>"The Count of Bearn was recompensed for his services of
twenty years with merely the same title. What degradation!
Is the monarchy indeed going to the dogs?" cried the indignant
lady.</p>

<p>"I do not know about the government, but the crumbs are
going to them, and, faith! we must scramble among them
to get the tidbits away from them. If you wanted to be welcomed
by Lady Dubarry, you could not do better than carry
these papers for her pet to her."</p>

<p>"It is plain that fate is against me; for, though your lordship
has kindly greeted me, the next step is out of the question.
Not only am I to pay court to a Dubarry, but I must
carry her negro-boy's appointment&mdash;a black whom I would
not have deigned to kick out of my way on the street&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly the usher interrupted:</p>

<p>"Viscount Jean Dubarry."</p>

<p>The chancellor dropped his hands in stupor, while the old
petitioner sank back in an armchair without pulse or breath.</p>

<p>Our old acquaintance pranced in, with his arm in a sling:</p>

<p>"Oh, engaged? Pray, do not disturb yourself, my lady; I
want only a couple of minutes to make a complaint, a couple
of his precious minutes. They have tried to murder me! I
did not mind their making fun at us, singing lewd ballads,
slandering and libeling us; but it is too much of a vile thing
to waylay and murder. But I am interrupting the
lady."</p>

<p>"This is the Countess of Bearn," said the chancellor.</p>

<p>Dubarry drew back gracefully to make a proper bow, and
the lady did the same for her courtesy, and they saluted as
ceremoniously as though they had been in court.</p>

<p>"After you, viscount," she said; "my case is about property;
yours about honor, and so takes the lead."</p>

<p>Profiting by her obligingness Dubarry unfolded his complaint.</p>

<p>"You will want witnesses on your side," observed the
chancellor.</p>

<p>"That is awkward, for everybody there seems to be on the
other side."</p>

<p>"Not everybody," interrupted the countess, "for if the affray
was the one that happened in Chaussee village, I can be<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>
your witness. I came through there a couple of hours after,
and all were talking of it!"</p>

<p>"Have a care, my <a name="tn_png_88"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "lady," on Page 86-->lady," said the viscount; "for if you
speak in my favor, you will make an enemy of Choiseul."</p>

<p>"She ought to lean on your arm, then; though one is
wounded, it will soon be healed, and the other is still formidable,"
said the law lord, while the old dame rolled from one
gulf into another.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I know another, whose arms are perfect," said
Jean, merrily; "and service for service, she will offer your
ladyship hers. I am going straight to my sister, and I offer
you a seat in my carriage."</p>

<p>"But without motive, without preparations," faltered the
countess.</p>

<p>"Here is your excuse," whispered Maupeou, slipping
Zamore's governmental instructions into her sallow, wrinkled
hand.</p>

<p>"My lord chancellor, you are my deliverer," she gasped.
"And the viscount is the flower of the chivalry."</p>

<p>Indeed, a splendid coach in the royal colors was waiting at
the doors. The countess placed herself in it, swelling with
pride. Jean entered likewise, and gave the word for the departure.</p>

<p>In her joy at this smooth sailing, the countess forgot that
she had wanted to lay a private complaint before the chancellor
as head of the legal fraternity.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that Chon had decoyed her into
traveling to Paris by pretending to be the daughter of her
lawyer Flageot.</p>

<p>What was her amazement, therefore, on calling on that
gentleman, to learn that not only was he a bachelor without
a daughter, but that he had no good news to impart to her
on her suit. Burning with disappointment, she had sought a
remedy against this lawyer or this woman who had hoaxed
her.</p>

<p><span class="firstwords">After</span> the king's departure from the short and unpleasant
call, as he termed it to the courtiers, the Countess Dubarry
remained closeted with Chon and her brother, who had kept
in the background for fear that his wound would be found to
be but a scratch. The outcome of this family council was that
the countess, instead of going to Luciennes, went to a private
house of hers in Valois Street, Paris.</p>

<p>Jeanne read a book while Zamore, at the window, watched
for the carriage to return. When the viscount brought the<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>
old countess he left her in the anteroom while he ran to tell
his sister of his success.</p>

<p>"Where is <a name="tn_png_89"></a><!--TN: Exclamation mark changed to a question mark after "Chon" on Page 87-->Chon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"At Versailles, where I bade her keep close."</p>

<p>"Then go in, my princess."</p>

<p>Lady Dubarry opened the boudoir door and walked into
her visitor's presence.</p>

<p>"I have already thanked my brother," she said, "for having
procured me the honor of your ladyship's visit; but I
must thank you at present for making it."</p>

<p>"I cannot find expressions," said the delighted suitor, "to
show my gratitude for the kind reception granted me."</p>

<p>"Allow me," said Jean, as the ladies took seats; "the
countess must not seem to be applying to you for a favor. The
chancellor has confided a commission for you, that is all."</p>

<p>The visitor gave the speaker a thankful look, and handed
the letters patent from the chancellor which created Luciennes
a royal castle and intrusted Zamore with the governership.</p>

<p>"It is I who am obliged," said the younger countess, "and
I shall consider myself happy when the chance comes for me
to do something in my turn."</p>

<p>"That will be easy," cried the other with a quickness delighting
the pair of plotters. "You will not be ignorant of
my name?"</p>

<p>"How could we? The name of the princess to whom we
owe King Henry the Fourth?"</p>

<p>"Then you may have heard of a lawsuit which ties up my
property."</p>

<p>"Claimed by the Saluces? Yes, the king was talking of the
matter with Chancellor Maupeou, my cousin, the other evening."</p>

<p>"The king talked of my case? In what terms, pray?"</p>

<p>"Alas! he seemed to think that it ought to be the Saluces."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! then we would have to pay twice over a
sum which morally was paid. I have not the receipt, I grant,
but I can prove payment <a name="tn_png_89a"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "morally." on Page 87-->morally."</p>

<p>"I think moral proofs are accepted," said Jean gravely.</p>

<p>"The claim of two hundred thousand livres, with interest,
now amounting to a capital of over a million, dated 1406. It
must have been settled by Guy Gaston IV., Count of Bearn,
because on his deathbed, in 1417, he wrote in his will 'Owing
no debts,' and so on."</p>

<p>"That settles it," said Jean.</p>

<p>"But your adversaries hold the note?" said the countess,
pretending to take an interest in the subject.</p>

<p>"Yes, that embroils it," said the old lady, who ought to have
said, "This clears it up."</p>

<p>"It terribly changes the position for the Saluces."</p>

<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>

<p>"Oh, my lady, I would that you were one of the judges!"</p>

<p>"In olden times, you might have claimed a champion to do
battle for you. I have such belief in your case that I would
go into the lists for you. Unfortunately we have not to do
with knights but a gang of robbers in black gowns, who will
not understand so plain an expression as 'I die owing no
debts.'"</p>

<p>"Stay, though; as the words were spoken three hundred
years ago they would be outlawed, I think," ventured
Countess Dubarry.</p>

<p>"But you would be convinced of the lady's rights, sister,
if you were to hear her, as I have heard coming along."</p>

<p>"Then do me the favor of coming out to my place at
Luciennes, where, by the way, the king drops in now and
again."</p>

<p>"But I cannot rely on such a chance, for the case is called
Monday, and this is Friday."</p>

<p>"What the deuce can be done?" grumbled the viscount,
appearing to meditate profoundly.</p>

<p>"If I could have a royal hearing at Versailles through
your introduction?" suggested the old lady.</p>

<p>"Not to be thought of. The king does not like me to meddle
with law or politics. And at present he is worried about
my presentation to the court."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the aged litigant.</p>

<p>"The king wants it to come off before the new dauphiness
arrives, so that my sister can go to the festivities at Compiegne,
in spite of Choiseul's opposition, Praslin's intrigues and Lady
Grammont's intervention."</p>

<p>"I understand. The countess has no introductress?" queried
Lady Bearn, timidly.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, we have Baroness Alogny, only the king
would prefer somebody with a historical name."</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I ever heard of the Alognys," hissed
the old descendant of kings with incredible envy.</p>

<p>"It will be a grand thing for her, for the king is tired of
the jades who put on airs prouder than himself!" said Jean.
"I could make Lady Alogny draw off by telling her what
the king said."</p>

<p>"It would be unfair," <a name="tn_png_90"></a><!--TN: "said the" added before "viscount" on Page 88-->said the viscount.</p>

<p>"What a pity! for in that case, here is a lady of ancient
lineage, and regal. She would win her lawsuit, her son could
have a lieutenancy in the household troops, and as Lady
Bearn must have gone to much outlay in her trips to Paris,
she would have compensation out of the privy purse. Such
luck does not rain down twice in a lifetime."</p>

<p>"Alas! no," said Lady Bearn, crushed in her chair by all
things being against her.</p>

<p>"An idea strikes me," said Jean. "All has been kept quiet,<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>
and so the king does not know that we have a lady patroness to
present my sister. Suppose you were at Versailles and expressed
your willingness to act as social sponsor for my sister.
Why, the king would accept one who is his relative, and that
would prevent the Alognys complaining. The king could do
no wrong."</p>

<p>"The king would do right about the suit," said Jeanne.
"He would be delighted and he would be sure to say to Chancellor
Maupeou: <a name="tn_png_91"></a><!--TN: Double quote removed and single quotes placed around quotation within a quote on Page 89-->'I want you to treat Lady Bearn properly,
my lord!'"</p>

<p>"But this may look bad, when everybody thinks my case
lost," objected the old countess.</p>

<p>"Well, let it be lost," returned the other lady quickly:
"What matter, if you are compensated?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand livres?" said the other with
sorrow.</p>

<p>"Pooh, what if there be a royal present of a hundred thousand
livres?"</p>

<p>"I have a son," remarked the victim, while the two eyed
her greedily.</p>

<p>"So much the better, as he will be another servitor for the
king; he must not have less than a cornetcy in the army,"
said Jean. "Any other kinsmen?"</p>

<p>"A nephew."</p>

<p>"We shall find a berth for him."</p>

<p>"We rely on your invention," said Countess Dubarry, rising.
"You will allow me to mention your ladyship to the
king?"</p>

<p>"Do me the honor," said the old dame with a sigh.</p>

<p>"No later than this evening," said the royal favorite. "I
trust I have won your friendship?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though I believe I am in a dream."</p>

<p>But the dream only lasted to the foot of the stairs, where
Countess Bearn was conducted on Jean's hale arm, for there
the irrepressible Chon came bounding out of a sedan chair.
Lady Bearn recognized the pretended daughter of Lawyer
Flageot.</p>

<p>"It is Mistress Chon," roared Zamore.</p>

<p>"Is that little fool Gilbert here?" asked Chon of the footmen,
when she suddenly looked up and saw Jean trying to
hush her.</p>

<p>She followed the direction of his finger and perceived Lady
Bearn. She gave a scream, lowered her cap-veil, and plunged
into the vestibule.</p>

<p>Appearing to notice nothing, the old lady got into the carriage
and gave her address to the coachman.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">ANNOYANCE AND AMUSEMENT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> king had been at Luciennes from three o'clock till dark,
when, supremely wearied, he reposed on a sofa in a sitting-room,
where Countess Dubarry surprised him about half-past
ten.</p>

<p>Zamore was at the door when she woke him up.</p>

<p>"Have you come at last, countess?" he said.</p>

<p>"At last? I have been waiting for you this hour. How
soundly your Majesty sleeps."</p>

<p>"I have slept three hours. But what do I see there?"</p>

<p>"That is the governor of Luciennes. The chancellor sent
me the appointment, and so he donned the uniform. Swear
him in quickly, and let him begin guarding us."</p>

<p>Zamore marched up, wearing a showy lace dress, with a
sword. His huge three-cocked hat was under his arm. He
went down on his knees, laid one hand on his heart, the other
one was placed in the king's, and he said:</p>

<p>"Me swear faith and homage to my massa and missee; me
will defend the castle placed under my guard to the last gasp,
and me will not surrender it till the last can of jelly is eaten."</p>

<p>The sovereign laughed, less at the comic oath than at the
black boy's gravity in taking it.</p>

<p>"In return for this pledge," he said with due seriousness,
"I confer on you, Sir Governor, the sovereign right of dealing
out justice to the extent of capital punishment over all in
your hold, in earth, air, fire and water."</p>

<p>"Thankee, massa," said Zamore, rising.</p>

<p>"Now, run away into the servants hall and show your fine
trappings."</p>

<p>As Zamore went out by one door, Chon came in by another.
The king took her on his knee and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Chon. I like you because you tell me the
truth. I want to know what has made your sister so late in
hunting me <a name="tn_png_92"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "up." on Page 90-->up."</p>

<p>"No, Jeanne is the one to tell the truth. Still, if you will
pay me for my report, I will show you that my police spies
are up to the mark of Chief Sartines'."</p>

<p>"I have the pay ready," said the king, jingling some coins
in his pocket. "No fibs."</p>

<p>"The Countess Dubarry went to her private residence in
Valois Street, Paris, where Zamore met her about six o'clock.
She went to speak with her sponsor."</p>

<p>"What, is she going to be baptized?"</p>

<p>"Her social sponsor&mdash;I do not know the right name for it."</p>

<p>"Say, the lady patroness. So you have fabricated one."</p>

<p>"Nay, she is ready made, and from away back. It is
Countess Bearn, of the family of reigning princes. I guess<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>
she will not disgrace the line which is allied with the Royal
Stuarts, the Dubarry-Moores."</p>

<p>"I never knew of any Countess Bearn but the one who
lives by Verdun."</p>

<p>"The very one, who will call to-morrow at seven for a
private audience. If the question will be allowed, she will ask
when the introduction is to take place, and you will fix it
shortly, eh, my Lord of France," said the countess.</p>

<p>The king laughed, but not frankly.</p>

<p>"To-morrow at eleven?"</p>

<p>"At our breakfast hour."</p>

<p>"Impossible, my darling, for I must away; I have important
business with Sartines."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you cannot even stay supper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The king saw her make a sign to Chon, and suspecting a
trap, he called for his horses to go. Delighted with this display
of his free will, he walked to the door, but his gentlemen
in waiting were not in the outer room. The castle was mute,
even in its echoes to his call.</p>

<p>He ran and opened the window, but the courtyard was
deserted. The tremulous moon shone on the river and lit up
the calm night. This harmony was wasted on the king, who
was far from poetic, artistic or musing, but rather material.</p>

<p>"Come, come, countess!" he broke forth in vexation; "put
an end to this joke."</p>

<p>"Sire, I have no authority here," said the countess. "It is
a royal residence, and the power is confided in the governor.
And Governor Zamore is going the rounds with his guard of
four men."</p>

<p>The king rather forced a smile.</p>

<p>"This is rather funny," he said. "But I want the horses
put to my coach."</p>

<p>"The governor has locked them up in the stables for fear
robbers might get at them. As for the escort, they are asleep,
by orders of the governor, too."</p>

<p>"Then I will walk out of the castle alone."</p>

<p>"Hardly, for the gates are locked and the keys hang at the
governor's belt."</p>

<p>"Pest on it! we have one castle strictly guarded!"</p>

<p>The countess lounged on a divan, playing with a rose, less
red than her coral lips.</p>

<p>"But we might go in quest of him," she said, rising.
"Chon, carry the light before his majesty."</p>

<p>The little procession of three had barely reached the end of
the first hall before a whiff of delicious odor set the royal
mouth watering.</p>

<p>"You smell supper, my lord," explained the countess. "I
thought you were going to partake with me, and I had a feast
prepared."</p>

<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>

<p>The king reflected that if he went on to Marly he would find
nothing but a cold collation. Here, through a doorway open
he saw a table set for two. The odor continued to scent the
house.</p>

<p>"Bless us! you have a good cook."</p>

<p>"I do not know, for this is his first attempt to please us. I
engaged him because he has a reputation for a choice omelet
of pheasants' eggs."</p>

<p>"My favorite dish! I should not like to grieve your new
cook, countess, and I might taste it while we wait for the
governor to finish his inspection. But who will wait upon
us?" he asked, entering.</p>

<p>"I hope to do so without upsetting any of this iced champagne&mdash;a
new invention, of which I wish your opinion."</p>

<p>"I fear I shall never take it from your hand, for it fascinates
me into solely admiring it."</p>

<p>"Ah, if my hired eulogists would say something so sweet
as that!"</p>

<p>"I see that I must let you have your own way," and he settled
down in an easy chair like one who was put in good
humor by the prospect of a luxurious repast.</p>

<p>They finished it with coffee burnt in brandy, with a paper
which the king held while the fair cajoler lighted.</p>

<p>"That is bad luck to the Choiseul party," said she; "that
was one of the lampoons against us which they inspire and
allow to be circulated."</p>

<p>"Did I call you a fay? I mistook: you are a demon."</p>

<p>The countess rose.</p>

<p>"I think I had better see if Governor Zamore is not on the
return."</p>

<p>But the king shook his head, inflamed by the punch, the
tokay and the champagne. He was conscious of still another
perfume, and his nose directed him to a doorway suddenly
opened. It led into a tempting chamber, hung with sky-blue
satin, embroidered with flowers in their natural colors, an
alcove where a mysterious soft light reigned.</p>

<p>"Well, sire, the governor seems to have locked us in. And
unless we save ourselves out of window with the curtains&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, do not let us pull them down&mdash;rather, draw them
close!"</p>

<p>He opened his arms, laughing, and the beauty let the rose
fall from her teeth and it burst all its petals open as it reached
the carpet.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">COUNTESS CUT COUNTESS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">On</span> the road to Paris from Luciennes the poor Countess
Dubarry was racing along like a disembodied spirit. An<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
advice from her brother Jean had dashed her down when she
had brought the king to the point of arranging for her presentation
day.</p>

<p>"So the old donkey has fooled us?" she cried, when she was
alone with him.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so. But listen: I stayed in town because I
am not trustful like you&mdash;and I am not wrong. An hour
before the time when I ought to call for the old countess at
her inn, I met my man Patrick at the door, where I had sent
him to stand sentry since daybreak. He had seen nothing
wrong, and I left the carriage and went up stairs quite assured.
At her door a woman stopped me to say that her mistress
had upset the chocolate, which she boiled herself, on her
foot, and was crippled."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens! you drive me to despair, Jean."</p>

<p>"I am not in despair. You can do what I could not; if there
be any imposture you can discover it, and somehow we will
punish her. I was consulting a lawyer; he says we must not
thrash a person in a house; it is fine and prison, while without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beat a woman, a countess of the old stock? You mad
rogue, let me rather see her and try another method."</p>

<p>Jean conducted her to the Chanticleer Inn, where the old
lady dwelt. At the foot of the stairs she was stopped by the
landlady.</p>

<p>"Countess Bearn is ill," she said.</p>

<p>"Just so; I am coming to see how she is," and Jeanne
darted by her as nimble as a fawn.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship here!" ejaculated the old lady, on seeing
the court beauty's face screwed up into the conventional expression
of condolence.</p>

<p>"I have only just learnt of the accident. You seem to be
in much pain."</p>

<p>"My right foot is scalded. But misfortunes will happen."</p>

<p>"But you know the king expected you this morning?"</p>

<p>"You double my despair, lady."</p>

<p>"His majesty was vexed at your not coming."</p>

<p>"My excuse is in my sufferings, and I must present my
most humble excuses to his majesty."</p>

<p>"I am not saying this to cause you pain," said Lady Dubarry,
seeing that the old noblewoman was angry, "but just to
show you how set his majesty was on seeing you for the step
which made him grateful. I regret the accident the more as
I think it was due to your excitement from meeting a certain
person abruptly at my house."</p>

<p>"The lady who came as I went away?"</p>

<p>"The same; my sister, Mademoiselle Dubarry; only she
bore another name when you met her&mdash;that of Mademoiselle
Flageot."</p>

<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the old dame, with unhidden sourness.
"Did you send her to deceive me?"</p>

<p>"No, to do you a service at the same time as you did me
one. Let us speak seriously. In spite of your wound, painful
but not dangerous, could you make the effort to ride to
Luciennes and stand up a short while before the king?"</p>

<p>"Impossible; if you could bear the sight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish to assure myself of its extent."</p>

<p>To her great surprise, while writhing in agony, the lady
let Jeanne undo the bandage and expose a burn, horridly raw.
It spoke eloquently, for, as Lady Bearn had seen and recognized
Chon, this self-inflicted hurt raised her to the height of
Mutius Scaevola.</p>

<p>The visitor mutely admired. Come to consciousness, the
old countess fully enjoyed her triumph; her wild eye gloated
on the young woman kneeling at her foot. The latter replaced
the bands with the tenderness of her sex to the ailing, placed
the limb on the cushions as before, and said as she took a seat
beside her:</p>

<p>"You are a grander character than I suspected. I ask your
pardon for not having gone straight to business at the start.
Name your conditions."</p>

<p>"I want the two hundred thousand livres at stake in my
lawsuit to be guaranteed me," replied the old dame, with a
firmness clearly proving that one queen was speaking with
another.</p>

<p>"But that would make double if you won your case."</p>

<p>"No, for I look upon the sum I am contesting with the
Saluces for as mine own. The like sum is something to thank
you for in addition to the honor of your acquaintance. I ask
a captaincy and a company for my son, who has martial
instincts inborn but would make a bad soldier because
he is fit for officership alone. A captaincy now, with a promotion
to a colonelcy next year."</p>

<p>"Who is to raise the regiment?"</p>

<p>"The king, for if I spent my money in so doing I should be
no better off. I ask the restitution of my vineyard in
Touraine; the royal engineers took six acres for the Grand
Canal, and condemning it at the expert's valuation I was
cheated out of half price. I went to some law expenses in the
matter and my whole bill at Lawyer Flageot's is nearly ten
thousand livres."</p>

<p>"I will pay this last bill out of my own purse," said
Jeanne. "Is this all?"</p>

<p>"Stay, I cannot appear before our great monarch thus.
Versailles and its splendors have been so long strange to me
that I have no dresses."</p>

<p>"I foresaw that, and ordered a costume at the same maker's
as mine own. It will be ready by noon <a name="tn_png_96"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "to-morrow." on Page 94-->to-morrow."</p>

<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>

<p>"I have no jewels."</p>

<p>"The court jewelers will loan you my set called the 'Louise,'
as I bought them when the Princess Louise sold her jewels to
go into the nunnery. They will charge you two hundred
thousand and ten livres, but will take it back in a day or two
for two hundred thousand, so that thus you will receive that
sum in cash."</p>

<p>"Very well, countess; I have nothing to desire."</p>

<p>"I will write you my pledges, but first, the little letter to
the king, which I beg to dictate. We will exchange the documents."</p>

<p>"That is fair," said the old fox, drawing the table toward
her, and getting the pen and paper ready, as Lady Dubarry
spoke.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sire</span>: The happiness I feel at seeing your majesty's acceptance
of my offer to present the Countess Dubarry at court&mdash;&mdash;"</p></blockquote>

<p>The pen stuck and spluttered.</p>

<p>"A bad pen; you should change it!"</p>

<p>"Never mind; it must be broken in."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"&mdash;emboldens me (the letter proceeded) to solicit your majesty's
favorable eye when I appear at Versailles to-morrow
under permission. I venture to hope for a kind welcome from
my kinship to a house of which every head has shed his blood
in the service of your august ancestors. <span class="alignright"><span class="smcap">Anastasie Euphramie Rodolphe</span>, Countess of Bearn."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>In return, the plotter handed over the notes and the order
on her jewelry.</p>

<p>"Will you let me send my brother for you at three o'clock
with the <a name="tn_png_97"></a><!--TN: Period changed to a question mark followed by a quote after "coach." on Page 95-->coach?"</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>"Mind you take care of yourself."</p>

<p>"Fear nothing. I am a noblewoman, and as you have my
word, I will keep it to-morrow though I die for it."</p>

<p>So they parted, the old countess, lying down, going over
her documents, and the young one lighter than she arrived,
but with her heart aching at not having baffled the old litigant
who easily defeated the king of France. In the main room,
she perceived her brother, draining a second bottle of wine in
order not to rouse suspicions on his reasons for staying in the
inn. He jumped up and ran to her.</p>

<p>"How goes it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"As Marshal Saxe said to the king on showing him the
field of Fontenoy: 'Sire, learn by this sight how dear and
agonizing a victory <a name="tn_png_97a"></a><!--TN: Single quote added after "is." on Page 95-->is.'"</p>

<p>"But you have a patroness?"</p>

<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>

<p>"Yes, but she costs us a million! It is cruel; but I could
not help myself. Mind how you handle her, or she may back
out, or charge double her present price."</p>

<p>"What a woman! A Roman!"</p>

<p>"A Spartan. But bring her to Luciennes at three, for I shall
not be easy till I have her under lock and key."</p>

<p>As the countess sprang into the coach, Jean watched her
and muttered:</p>

<p>"By Cr&oelig;sus, we cost France a nice round sum! It is
highly flattering to the Dubarrys."</p>

<span class="chapterhead">AT A LOSS FOR EVERYTHING.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">At</span> eleven <span class="smaller">A. M.</span>, Lady Dubarry arrived at her house in
Valois Street, determined to make Paris her starting-point for
her march to Versailles. Lady Bearn was there, kept close
when not under her eye, with the utmost art of the doctors
trying to alleviate the pain of her burn.</p>

<p>From over night Jean and Chon and the waiting-woman
had been at work and none who knew not the power of gold
would have believed in the wonders they wrought in short
time.</p>

<p>The hairdresser was engaged to come at six o'clock; the
dress was a marvel on which twenty-six seamstresses were
sewing the pearls, ribbons and trimmings, so that it would be
done in time instead of taking a week as usual. At the same
hour as the hairdresser, it would be on hand. As for the
coach, the varnish was drying on it in a shed built to heat the
air. The mob flocked to see it, a carriage superior to any
the dauphiness had; with the Dubarry war-cry emblazoned
on the panels: "Charge Onward!" palliated by doves billing
and cooing on one side, and a heart transfixed with a dart on
the other. The whole was enriched with the attributes of Cupid
bows, quivers and the hymeneal torch. This coach was to
be at the door at nine.</p>

<p>While the preparations were proceeding at the favorites'
the news ran round the town.</p>

<p>Idle and indifferent as the Parisians pretend to be, they are
fonder of novelty than any other people. Lady Dubarry in
her regal coach paraded before the populace like an actress
on the stage.</p>

<p>One is interested in those whose persons are known.</p>

<p>Everybody knew the beauty, as she was eager to show herself
in the playhouse, on the promenade and in the stores,
like all pretty, rich and young belles. Besides, she was known
by her portraits, freaks, and the funny negro boy Zamore.
People crowded the Palais Royal, not to see Rousseau play
chess, worse luck to the philosophers! but to admire the lovely<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>
fairy in her fine dresses and gilded coach, which were so talked
about.</p>

<p>Jean Dubarry's saying that "the Dubarrys cost the country
a nice sum" was deep, and it was only fair that France who
paid the bill, should see the show.</p>

<p>Jeanne knew that the French liked to be dazzled; she was
more one of the nation than the queen, a Polander; and as
she was kindly, she tried to get her money's worth in the
display.</p>

<p>Instead of lying down for a rest as her brother suggested,
she took a bath of milk for her complexion, and was ready by
six for the hairdresser. A headdress for a lady to go to the
court in was a building which took time, in those days. The
operator had to be not only a man of art, but of patience.
Alone among the craftsmen, hairdressers were allowed to wear
the sword like gentlemen.</p>

<p>At six o'clock the court hairdresser, the great Lubin, had
not arrived. Nor at a quarter past seven; the only hope was
that, like all great men, Lubin was not going to be held cheap
by coming punctually.</p>

<p>But a running-footman was sent to learn about him, and
returned with the news that Lubin had left his house and
would probably arrive shortly.</p>

<p>"There has been a block of vehicles on the way," explained
the viscount.</p>

<p>"Plenty of time," said the countess. "I will try on my
dress while awaiting him. Chon, fetch my dress."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship's sister went off ten minutes ago to get it,"
said Doris.</p>

<p>"Hark, to wheels!" interrupted Jean. "It is our coach."</p>

<p>No, it was Chon, with the news that the dressmaker, with
two of her assistants, was just starting with the dress to try it
on and finish fitting it. But she was a little anxious.</p>

<p>"Viscount," said the countess, "won't you send for the
coach?"</p>

<p>"You are right, Jeanne. Take the new horses to Francian
the coach-builder's," he ordered at the door, "and bring the new
coach with them harnessed to it."</p>

<p>As the sound of the departing horses was still heard,
Zamore trotted in with a letter.</p>

<p>"Buckra gemman give Zamore letter."</p>

<p>"What gentleman?"</p>

<p>"On horseback, at the door."</p>

<p>"Read it, dear, instead of questioning. I hope it is nothing
untoward."</p>

<p>"Really, viscount, you are very silly to be so frightened,"
said the countess, but on opening the letter, she screamed and
fell half dead on the lounge.</p>

<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>

<p>"No hairdresser! no dress! no coach!" she panted, while
Chon rushed to her and Jean picked up the letter.</p>

<p>Thus it ran in a feminine handwriting:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Be on your guard. You will have no hairdresser, dress
or coach this evening. I hope you will get this in time. As
I do not seek your gratitude, I do not name myself. If you
know of a sincere friend, take that as me."</p></blockquote>

<p>"This is the last straw," cried Jean in his rage. "By the
<a name="tn_png_100"></a><!--TN: Quote and indent removed before "Blue" on Page 98-->Blue Moon, I must kill somebody! No hairdresser? I will
scalp this Lubin. For it is half-past seven, and he has not
turned up. Malediction!"</p>

<p>He was not going to court, so he did not hesitate to tear at
his hair.</p>

<p>"The trouble is the dress," groaned Chon. "Hairdressers
can be found anywhere."</p>

<p>The countess said nothing, but she heaved a sigh which
would have melted the Choiseul party had they heard it. Then:</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Chon; "let us be calm. Let us hunt
up another hairdresser, and see about that dress not coming."</p>

<p>"Then there is the coach," said Jean. "It ought to have
been here by this. It is a plot. Will you not make Sartines
arrest the guilty ones&mdash;Maupeou sentence them to death&mdash;and
the whole gang be burned with their fellows on Execution
Place? I want to rack the hairdresser, break the dressmaker
on the wheel, and flay the coachbuilder alive."</p>

<p>The countess had come to her senses but only to see the
dreadful dilemma the better.</p>

<p>At the height of this scene of tribulation, echoing from the
boudoir to the street door, while the footmen were blundering
over each other in confusion at a score of different orders, a
young blade in an applegreen silk coat and vest, lilac breeches
and white silk stockings, skipped out of a cab, crossed the deserted
sill and the courtyard, bounded up the stairs and rapped
on the dressing-room door.</p>

<p>Jean was wrestling with a chins stand with which his coat-tail
was entangled, while steadying a huge Japanese idol
which he had struck too hard with his fist, when the three
knocks, wary, modest and delicate, came at the panel.</p>

<p>Jean opened it with a fist which would have beaten in the
gates of Gaza. But the stranger eluded the shock by a leap,
and falling on his feet in the third position of dancing, he
said:</p>

<p>"My lord, I come to offer my service as hairdresser to the
Countess Dubarry, who, I hear, is commanded to present herself
at court."</p>

<p>"A hairdresser!" cried the Dubarrys, ready to hug him<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>
and dragging him into the room. "Did Lubin send you?"</p>

<p>"You are an <a name="tn_png_101"></a><!--TN: Period changed to a comma after "angel" on Page 99-->angel," said the countess.</p>

<p>"Nobody sent me," returned the young man. "I read in
the newspapers that your ladyship was going to court this
evening, and I thought I might have a chance of showing that
I have a new idea for a court headdress."</p>

<p>"What might be your name, younker?" demanded Jean,
distrustfully.</p>

<p>"Leonard, unknown at present, but if the lady will only
try me, it will be celebrated to-morrow. Only I must see her
dress, that I may create the headdress in harmony."</p>

<p>"Oh my dress, my poor, poor dress!" moaned the countess,
recalled to reality by the allusion. "What is the use of having
one's hair done up, when one has no robe?" and she fell back
on the lounge.</p>

<p>At this instant the doorbell rang. It was a dress-box
which the janitor took from a porter in the street, which the
butler took from him and which Jean tore out of his hands.
He took off the lid, plunged his hand into the depths and
yelled with glee. It enclosed a court dress of China satin,
with flowers <i>appliqué</i>, and the lace trimming of incredible
value.</p>

<p>"A dress!" gasped Jeanne, almost fainting with joy as she
had with grief. "But how can it suit me, who was not
measured for it?"</p>

<p>Chon tried it with the tape measure.</p>

<p>"It is right in length and width of the waist," said Chon.
"This is fabulous."</p>

<p>"The material is wonderful," said Jean.</p>

<p>"The whole is terrifying," said the countess.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! This only proves that if you have bitter
enemies, you have some sweet friends."</p>

<p>"It cannot be a mere human friend, Jean," said Chon, "for
how would such know the mischief set against us? it must
be a sylph."</p>

<p>"I don't care if it is the Old Harry, if he will help me
against the Grammonts! He is not so black as those wretches,"
said the countess.</p>

<p>"Now I think of it, I wager you may entrust your hair to
this hairdresser, for <a name="tn_png_101a"></a><!--TN: Duplicate "he" removef after "for" on Page 99-->he must be sent by the same friend
who furnishes the dress," suggested Jean. "Own up that
your story was pure gammon?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," protested the young man, showing the newspaper.
"I kept it to make the curls for the hair."</p>

<p>"It is no use, for I have no carriage."</p>

<p>"Hark, here it is rolling up to our door," exclaimed Chon.</p>

<p>"Quick!" shouted Jean, "do not let them get away without
our knowing to whom we owe all these kindnesses."</p>

<p>And he rushed with janitor, steward and footmen out on<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>
the street. It was too late. Before the door stood two magnificent
bay horses, with a gilded coach, lined with white
satin. Not a trace of driver or footmen. A man in the
street had run up to get the job of holding the horses and
those who brought them had left him in charge. A hasty
hand had blotted out the coat of arms on the panels and
painted a rose.</p>

<p>All this counter-action to the misadventures had taken
place in an hour.</p>

<p>Jean had the horses brought into the yard, locking the
gates and pocketing the key. Then he returned to the room
where the hairdresser was about to give the lady the first
proofs of his skill.</p>

<p>"Miracle!" said Chon, "the robe fits perfectly, except an
inch out in front, too long; but we can take it up in a
minute."</p>

<p>"Will the coach pass muster?" inquired the countess.</p>

<p>"It is in the finest taste. I got into it to try the springs,"
answered Jean. "It is lined with white satin, and scented with
attar of roses."</p>

<p>"Then everything is going on swimmingly," said the
<a name="tn_png_102a"></a><!--TN: Period removed after "countess" on Page 100-->countess <a name="tn_png_102b"></a><!--TN: "Clapping" changed to "clapping" on page 100-->clapping her hands. "Go on, Master Leonard; if
you succeed your fortune is made."</p>

<p>With the first stroke of the comb, Leonard showed that he
was an experienced hand. In three-quarters of an hour, Lady
Dubarry came forth from his hands more seductive than Aphrodite;
for she had more clothes on her, and she was quite as
handsome.</p>

<p>"You shall be my own hairdresser," said the lady, eyeing
herself in a hand glass, "and every time you do my hair up
for a court occasion, you shall have fifty gold pieces. Chon,
count out a hundred to the artist, for I want him to consider
fifty as a retaining fee. But you must work for none but
me."</p>

<p>"Then take your money back, my lady. I want to be free.
Liberty is the primary boon of mankind."</p>

<p>"God bless us! It is a philosophic hairdresser!" groaned
Jean, lifting his hands. "What are we coming to? <a name="tn_png_102c"></a><!--TN: Period changed to a comma after "Well" on Page 100-->Well,
Master Leonard, take the hundred, and do as you deused well
please. Come to your coach, countess."</p>

<p>These words were addressed to Countess Bearn, who limped
out of the inner room.</p>

<p>"Four of you footmen take the lady between you," ordered
Jean, <a name="tn_png_102d"></a><!--TN: Quote added before "and" on Page 100-->"and carry her gently down the stairs. If she utters a
single groan, I will have you flogged."</p>

<p>Leonard disappeared during this delicate task.</p>

<p>"Where can he have slipped away?" the young countess
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Where? By some rat hole or bang through the wall!"<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>
said the viscount. "As the spirits cut away. Have a care,
my dear, lest your headdress becomes a wasp nest, your dress
a cobweb, and your carriage a pumpkin drawn by a pair of
mice, on arriving at Versailles."</p>

<p>Enunciating this dreadful threat, Viscount Jean got into
the carriage, in which was already placed Countess Bearn
and the happy woman to whom she was to stand sponsor.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE PRESENTATION.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Versailles</span> is still fine to look upon; but it was splendid
to view in the period of its glory.</p>

<p>Particularly was it resplendent when a great ceremony
was performed, when the wardrobes and warehouses were
ransacked to display their sumptuous treasures, and the dazzling
illuminations doubled the magic of its wealth.</p>

<p>It had degenerated, but it still was glowing when it
opened all its doors and lit up all its flambeaux to hail the
court reception of Countess Dubarry. The curious populace
forgot its misery and its rags before so much bewildering
show, and crammed the squares and Paris road.</p>

<p>All the palace windows spouted flame, and the skyrockets
resembled stars floating and shooting in a golden dust.</p>

<p>The king came out of his private rooms at ten precisely,
dressed with more care than usual, his lace being richer and
the jewels in his garter and shoe buckles being worth a fortune.
Informed by Satines that the court ladies were plotting
against his favorite, he was careworn and trembled with fury
when he saw none but men in the ante-chamber. But he took
heart when, in the queen's drawing-room, set aside for the
reception, he saw in a cloud of powder and diamond luster,
his three daughters, and all the ladies who had vowed the
night before to stay away. The Duke of Richelieu ran from
one to another, playfully reproaching them for giving in and
complimenting them on thinking better of it.</p>

<p>"But what has made you come, duke?" they naturally
challenged him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not here really&mdash;I am but the proxy for my
daughter, Countess Egmont. If you will look around you
will not see her; she alone, with Lady Grammont and Lady
Guemenee has kept the pledge to keep aloof. I am sure what
will happen to me for practically staying away. I shall be
sent into exile for the fifth time, or to the Bastille for the
fourth. That will end my plotting, and I vow to conspire
never again."</p>

<p>The king remarked the absentees, and he went up to the
Duke of Choiseul who affected the utmost calm and demanded:</p>

<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>

<p>"I do not see the Duchess of <a name="tn_png_104"></a><!--TN: "Gramont" changed to "Grammont" on page 102-->Grammont."</p>

<p>"Sire, my sister is not well, and she begs me to offer her
most humble respects," said Choiseul, only succeeding in
flimsy indifference.</p>

<p>"That is bad for her!" ominously said the sovereign, turning
his back on the duke and thus facing Prince Guemenee.</p>

<p>"Have you brought your wife?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Impossible, your majesty: when I went to bring her, she
was sick abed."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be worse," said the king. "Good-evening,
marshal," he said to Richelieu, who bowed with the suppleness
of a young courtier. "You do not seem to have a touch
of the complaint?"</p>

<p>"Sire, I am always in good health when I have the pleasure
of beholding your majesty."</p>

<p>"But I do not see your daughter the Countess of Egmont.
What is the reason of her <a name="tn_png_104a"></a><!--TN: "abscence" changed to "absence" on page 102-->absence?"</p>

<p>"Alas! sire," responded the old duke, assuming the most
sorrowful mien, "my poor child is the more indisposed from
the mishap depriving her of the happiness of this occasion,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady Egmont unwell, whose health was the most robust
in the realm! this is sad for her!" and the king turned
his back on the old courtier as he had on the others whom he
snubbed.</p>

<p>Gloomy, anxious and irritated, the king went over to the
window, and seizing the carved handle of the sash with one
hand, he cooled his fevered brow against the pane. The
courtiers could be heard chattering, like leaves rustling before
the tempest, while all eyes stared at the clock; it struck the
half-hour, when a great uproar of vehicles rumbling on the
yard cobblestones resounded under the carriage-way vault.
Suddenly the royal brow brightened and a flash shot from his
eyes.</p>

<p>"The Right Honorable Lady the Countess of Dubarry!"
roared the usher to the grand master of ceremonies. "The
Right Honorable the Countess of Bearn!"</p>

<p>Different sensations were making all hearts leap. Invincibly
drawn by curiosity, a flood of courtiers moved toward the
monarch.</p>

<p>The wife of the Marshal of Mirepoix was carried close up to
the king, and though she had been in the front of the anti-Dubarryists,
she clasped her hands ready for adoration, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely she is!"</p>

<p>The king turned and smiled on the speaker.</p>

<p>"But she is not a mere mortal," said Richelieu; "she is a
fairy," which won him the end of the smile.</p>

<p>In truth, never had the countess been fairer, more winsome<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>
in expression, more modest in bearing, more noble in figure,
more elegant in step or more cunning in showing emotion; her
like had never excited admiration in the queen's drawing-room.</p>

<p>Charmingly beautiful, richly but not flauntingly dressed
and notable for a tastefully novel headdress, she advanced
held by the hand of Countess Bearn. Spite of atrocious pangs,
the latter did not hobble or even wince, though the rouge fell
in flakes from her face as each step wrung her to the core.</p>

<p>All eyes turned on the singular pair.</p>

<p>The old dame, with an old-fashioned low-necked robe, and
her hair built up a foot high above her bright but deep-set
eyes like an osprey's, her splendid attire and her skeleton-tread,
seemed the image of the past giving her hand to the
present. This model of cold, dry dignity guiding decent and
voluptuous beauty, struck most with admiration and astonishment.</p>

<p>The vivid contrast made the king fancy that Countess Bearn
was bringing him his favorite more youthful and brilliant
than ever.</p>

<p>"You have a very fair novice to present, my lady," said he;
"but she also has a noble introductress, than whom there is
not one whom I am more pleased to see again at court."</p>

<p>The old lady courtesied.</p>

<p>"Go and bow to my daughters," whispered the monarch to
Jeanne, <a name="tn_png_105"></a><!--TN: Quote added before "and" on Page 103-->"and show that you know how to courtesy. I hope
you will not be dissatisfied with the way they reply to you."</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed upon his daughters and compelled them
to show politeness, and as Lady Dubarry bowed more lowly
than court etiquette prescribed, they were touched, and embraced
her with a cordiality which pleased their father.</p>

<p>Henceforward, the countess' success became a triumph.</p>

<p>The Duke of Richelieu, as the victor of Mahon, knew how
to maneuver; he went and placed himself behind the chair
ready for Countess Dubarry, so that he was near her when the
presentation was over, without having to battle with the
crowd. Lady Mirepoix, knowing how lucky her old friend
was in warfare, had imitated him, and drew her stool close to
the favorite's chair.</p>

<p>Supported by the royal love, and the favorable welcome of
the royal princesses, Jeanne looked less timidly around among
the noblemen, though it was among the ladies that she expected
enemies.</p>

<p>"Ah, my Lord of Richelieu," she said, "I had to come
here to find you, for you have let a week pass without calling
at Luciennes."</p>

<p>"I was preparing for the pleasure of seeing you here, certain
here to <a name="tn_png_105a"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "meet!" on Page 104-->meet!"
"I wish you had imparted the certainty to me, for I was<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>
none too sure on that head&mdash;considering that I am surrounded
by plots to thwart me."</p>

<p>She glared at the old gallant who bore the glance imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Plots? Goodness! what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"In the first place my hairdresser was spirited away."</p>

<p>"Was he, indeed! what a lucky thing that I sent you a
pearl of his craft whom my daughter the Countess of Egmont
found somewhere&mdash;an artiste most superior to the general run,
even to the royal perrukeers, my little Leonard."</p>

<p>"Leonard," repeated the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes, a little fellow who does up my Septimanie's tresses,
and whom she keeps hidden from all eyes, as a miser does his
cash-box. You are not complaining of him, I think, for your
ladyship is turned out, as barbers say, marvelously. Curiously
enough, the style reminds me of a sketch which the court
painter Boucher gave my daughter, for her to be dressed in
accord with it, had she not fallen ill. Poor Seppie! But you
were talking of plots?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they kept back my dress."</p>

<p>"This is odious! Though you are not to be pitied when arrayed
in such a choice China silk; with flower work applied;
now, had you <i>applied</i> to me in your quandary, as I hope you
will in the future, I would have sent you the dress my
daughter had made for her presence here&mdash;it is so like this,
that I could vow it is the same."</p>

<p>Countess Dubarry seized both his hands, beginning to
understand who was the enchanter who had saved her from
the embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was in your daughter's coach that I was
brought here?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I should know hers, for it was renovated for this occasion
with white satin; but there was no time to paint her
blazon upon the panels&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only time to paint a rose! Duke, you are a delightful
nobleman."</p>

<p>The old peer kissed the hands, of which he made a warm
and perfumed mask. Feeling them thrill, he started and
asked the cause.</p>

<p>"Who is that man yonder, in a Prussian officer's dress,
with black eyes and expressive countenance, by Prince
Guemenee?"</p>

<p>"Some superior officer whom the king of Prussia sends to
honor your presentation."</p>

<p>"Do not laugh, duke; but that man was in France three
or four years ago, and I have been seeking for him everywhere
without avail."</p>

<p>"You are in error, countess; the stranger is Count
Fenix, who arrived but yesterday."</p>

<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>

<p>"How hard he looks at me!"</p>

<p>"Nay, how tenderly everybody is looking at you!"</p>

<p>"Look, he is bowing to me!"</p>

<p>"Everybody is doing that, if they have not done so."</p>

<p>A prey to extraordinary emotion, the lady did not
heed the duke's compliments, and, with her sight
riveted on the stranger who captivated her attention, she
quitted Richelieu, in spite of herself, to move toward the
foreigner. The king was watching her and perceived the
movement. He thought she wanted him, and approached
her, as he had quite long enough stood aloof out of regard
for the social restrictions. But the countess was so engrossed
that her mind would not be diverted.</p>

<p>"Sire, who is that Prussian officer, now turning away
from Prince Guemenee to look this way?"</p>

<p>"The stout figure with the square face enframed in a
golden collar?&mdash;accredited from my cousin of Prussia&mdash;some
philosopher of his stamp. I am glad that German philosophy
celebrates the triumph of King Petticoat the Third, as they
nickname the Louis for their devotion to the sex of which you
are the brightest gem. His title is Count Fenix," added the
sovereign reflecting.</p>

<p>"It is he," thought Countess Dubarry, but as she kept
silence the king proceeded, raising his voice:</p>

<p>"Ladies, the dauphiness arrives at Compiegne to-morrow,
the journey having been shortened. Her royal highness will
receive at midday precisely. All the ladies <i>presented</i> at court
will be of the reception party, except those who were absent
to-day. The journey is fatiguing, and her highness can have
no desire to aggravate the ills of those who are indisposed."</p>

<p>He looked with severity at Choiseul, Guemenee and
Richelieu. A silence of terror surrounded the speaker, whose
words were fully understood as meaning disgrace.</p>

<p>"Sire, I pray the exception for the Countess of Egmont, as
she is the daughter of my most faithful friend, the Duke of
Richelieu."</p>

<p>"His Grace your friend?"</p>

<p>Approaching the old courtier who had comprehended from
the motion of the pleader's lips, he said:</p>

<p>"I hope Lady Egmont will be well enough to-morrow to
come?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sire. She would be fit for travel this hour, if
your majesty desired it." And he saluted with respect and
thankfulness.</p>

<p>The king leaned over to the countess' ear and whispered a
word.</p>

<p>"Sire, I am your majesty's most obedient servant." Her
reverence was accompanied by a most bewitching smile.</p>

<p>The king waved his hand and retired to his own rooms.</p>

<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>

<p>Scarcely had he crossed the threshold before the countess
turned more frightened than ever to the singular man who
had so monopolized her. Like the others, he had bowed as the
monarch withdrew, but his brow had worn a haughty, almost
menacing aspect. As soon as Louis had disappeared, he came
and paused within a step or two of Lady Dubarry.</p>

<p>Urged by invincible curiosity, she took a step toward him, so
that he could say in a low voice as he bent to her:</p>

<p>"Am I recognized, lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as my prophet of Louis XV. Square."</p>

<p>"Well," queried the man with the clear, steady gaze, "Did
I lie when I told you of becoming the Queen of France?"</p>

<p>"No; your prophecy is all but accomplished. Hence, I am
ready to keep my promise. Speak your wish."</p>

<p>"The place is ill chosen, and the time has not come."</p>

<p>"I am ready to fulfill it any time."</p>

<p>"Can I come any time?"</p>

<p>"Yes; will it be as Count Fenix?"</p>

<p>"My title will be Count Joseph Balsamo."</p>

<p>"I shall not forget it, Balsamo," repeated the favorite as the
mysterious stranger was merged with the crowd.</p>

his two brothers, and they had ridden out to meet the
princess from Austria. The gallant idea had not come to the
dauphin of his own impulse, but from his tutor, Lord Lavauguyon,
who had been instructed by the king on the proper
line of conduct to be followed by the heir to the throne.
Previous sovereigns had also taken this kind of preliminary
view of the fated spouse, without the veil of etiquette.</p>

<p>The eldest prince rode out, grave, and his two brothers, smiling.
At half after eight, they came back; the dauphin serious as
when he started, Provence almost sulky, and Artois gayer
than at the outset. The first was disquieted, the second
envious, and the last delighted&mdash;for all had found the lady
most lovely. Thus each betrayed his temperament.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the two parties, that of the king and the
bride of his son, all got out of the carriages, except the king
and the archduchess. Around the dauphin were all the
young nobles, while the old nobility clustered round the
king.</p>

<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>

<p>The lady's carriage door opened, and the Austrian princess
sprang lightly to the ground. As she advanced toward the
royal coach, Louis had the door opened, and eagerly stepped
out.</p>

<p>The princess had so exactly calculated the steps that she
threw herself on her knees just as he alighted. He stooped
to lift her up, and kissed her affectionately, covering her with
a look which caused her to redden.</p>

<p>She blushed again as the dauphin was presented to her.
She had pleasant words to say to all the royal princes and
princesses. But here came a hitch, till the king, glancing
around, spied the Countess Dubarry, and took her hand.</p>

<p>Everybody stepped aloof, so that the sovereign was left
alone with his favorite and the new arrival.</p>

<p>"I present the Countess Dubarry, my dearest friend!"</p>

<p>The Austrian turned pale, but the most kindly smile glittered
on her blanching lips.</p>

<p>"Your majesty is very happy in having so lovely a friend,"
she said, "and I am not surprised at the attachment she
inspires."</p>

<p>All looked on with astonishment approaching stupefaction.
It was evident that the new-comer was repeating the Austrian
court's instructions&mdash;perhaps her mother's own words.</p>

<p>While the princess entered the royal coach, passing the
Duke of Choisuel without noticing him, the church bells
clanged. Countess Dubarry radiantly got into her coach, up
to the door of which came Chevalier Jean.</p>

<p>"Do you know who that young whippersnapper is?" he
asked, pointing to a horseman at the dauphiness' coach window.
"That is Philip of Taverney, who gave me that sword
thrust."</p>

<p>"Well, who is the beautiful girl with whom he is talking?"</p>

<p>"His sister, and to my mind you have the same need to beware
of that girl as I of her brother."</p>

<p>"You are mad."</p>

<p>"I have my wits about me. I shall keep an eye on the
blade anyhow."</p>

<p>"And I shall watch the budding beauty."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Jean; "here comes your friend Richelieu."</p>

<p>"What is wrong, my dear duke? You look discontented,"
said the countess, with her sweetest smile.</p>

<p>"Does it not strike your ladyship that we are all very dull,
not to say sad, for such a joyous affair? I can recall going
out to meet another princess for the royal couch, amiable like
this one, and as fair. It was the dauphin's mother. We
were all jolly. Is it because we were younger?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear marshal, it is because the monarchy is older."</p>

<p>All who heard shuddered at this voice behind the duke.
He turned and saw an elderly gentleman, stylish in appear<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>ance,
who laid his hand on his shoulder as he smiled misanthropically.</p>

<p>"Gads my life! it is Baron Taverney. Countess," added the
duke, "here is one of my oldest friends, for whom I beg your
kindness&mdash;Baron Taverney of Redcastle."</p>

<p>"The father of that pair," said Jean and Jeanne to themselves,
as they bowed in salutation.</p>

<p>"My lords and gentlemen," shouted the grand master of
ceremonies, "to your places in the coaches."</p>

<p>The two aged nobles bowed to the favorite and her brother,
and went into the same vehicle, glad to be united after long
absence.</p>

<p>"What do you say to that? I do not like the old fellow
a whit better than the cubs," said Jean Dubarry.</p>

<p>"What a pity that the little imp, Gilbert, ran away. As
he was brought up in their house, he might furnish particulars
about the family," said the countess.</p>

<p>The dialogue was broken off by the movement of all the
carriages.</p>

<p>After a night at Compiegne, the united courts&mdash;the sundown
of one era, the sunburst of another&mdash;swept intermingled on to
Paris, that gulf which was to swallow up the whole of them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">GILBERT SNAPS GOLDEN CHAINS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">It</span> is time to return to Gilbert.</p>

<p>Our little philosopher had cooled in his admiration for Chon
since at the outbreak of the collision between Chevalier Jean
and Philip of Taverney he had learnt the name of his protectress.</p>

<p>Often, at Taverney, when he was skulking and listening to
the chat of the baron and his daughter, he had heard the old
noble express himself plainly about the favorite Dubarry.
His interested hatred had found a sympathetic echo in the
boy's bosom; and Andrea never contradicted her father's
abuse, for, it must be allowed, Lady Dubarry's name was
deeply scorned in the country.</p>

<p>What completely ranked Gilbert on the side of the old noble
was that Nicole had sometimes exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I wish I were Dubarry."</p>

<p>Chon was too busy after the duel to think about Gilbert, who
forgot his bad impression as he entered the court capital in his
frank admiration. He was still under the spell when he slept
in the attic of the royal palace. The only matter in his
dreams was that he, the poor boy, was lodged like the foremost
noblemen of France, without his being a courtier or a lackey.</p>

<p>Gilbert was in one of the thinking fits common to him when
events surpassed his will or comprehension, when he was told<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>
that Mademoiselle Chon wanted to see him. She was waiting
in her carriage for him to accompany her on a ride. She sat
in the front seat, with a large chest and a small dog. Gilbert
and a steward named Cranche were to have the other places.</p>

<p>To preserve his position, Gilbert sat behind Chon, and the
steward, without even thinking of objecting, sat behind the
dog and box.</p>

<p>Like all who lived in Versailles, Chon drew a free breath
with pleasure in quitting the grand palace for the woods and
pastures, and said as she turned half round on their leaving
the town:</p>

<p>"How does the philosopher like Versailles?"</p>

<p>"It is very fine. So we are quitting it so soon?"</p>

<p>"We are going to our place."</p>

<p>"Your place, you mean," grumbled Gilbert in the tone of a
bear becoming tamed.</p>

<p>"I mean that I am going to introduce you to my sister,
whom you must try to please, for she is hand and glove with
all the great lords of the kingdom. By the way, Master
Cranche, we must have a suit of clothes made for this young
gentleman."</p>

<p>"The ordinary livery?" queried the man.</p>

<p>"Livery?" snarled Gilbert, giving the upper servant a fierce
look.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I will tell you the style after I communicate my
notion to my sister. But it must be ready at the same time as
Zamore's new clothes."</p>

<p>Gilbert was startled at this talk.</p>

<p>"Zamore is a little playfellow for you, the governor of the
royal castle of Luciennes," explained Chon. "Make friends
with him, as he is a good fellow, in spite of his color."</p>

<p>Gilbert was eager to know what color Zamore was, but he reflected
that philosophers ought not to be reproved for inquisitiveness,
and he contained himself.</p>

<p>"I will try," replied the youth with a smile which he
thought full of dignity.</p>

<p>Luciennes was what had been described to him.</p>

<p>"So this is the pleasure house which has cost the country
so dearly!" he mused.</p>

<p>Joyous dogs and eager servants came to greet the mistress'
sister. Jeanne had not come, and Chon was glad to see
her first of all.</p>

<p>"Sylvie," she said to a pretty girl who came to take the
lap dog and the chest, "give Misapoof and the box to
Cranche, and take my little philosopher to Zamore!"</p>

<p>The chambermaid did not know what kind of animal a
philosopher was, but Chon's glance directed her to Gilbert,
and she beckoned him to follow her. But for the tone of command
which Chon had used, the youth would have taken<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>
Sylvie for other than a servant. She was dressed more like
Andrea than Nicole. She gave Gilbert a smile, for the
recommendation denoted that Chon had a fancy, if not
affection for the new-comer.</p>

<p>Gilbert was rather daunted by the idea of appearing before
so grand an official as a royal governor, but the words
that Zamore was a good fellow reassured him. Friend of a
viscount and a court lady already, he might face a governor.</p>

<p>"How the court is slandered!" he thought; "for it is easy
to make friends among the courtiers. They are kind and hospitable."</p>

<p>In a noble Roman room, on cushions, with crossed legs,
squatted Zamore, eating candies out a satin bag.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the incipient philosopher, "what do you
call this thing?"</p>

<p>"Me no ting&mdash;me gubbernor," blubbered Zamore.</p>

<p>Gilbert had never before seen a negro. The uneasy glance
which he turned up to Sylvie caused that lively girl to burst
into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>Grave and motionless as an idol, Zamore kept on diving
with his paw in the bag of sweetmeats and munching away.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened to give admission to
Steward Cranche and a tailor to take the measures of Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Do not pull him about too much," said the steward.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am done," said the knight of the thimble; "the
costume of Sganarelle is a loose one, and we never bother
about a fit."</p>

<p>"Oh, he will look fine as Sganarelle," said Sylvie. "And
is he to have the high hat like Mother Goose's?"</p>

<p>Gilbert did not hear the reply, as he pushed aside the tailor
and would not help any more preparations. He did not know
that Sganarelle was a comic character in a popular play, but
he saw that it was a ludicrous one, and he was enlightened
further by Sylvie's laughter. She departed with tailor and
steward, leaving him alone with the black boy, who continued
to roll his eyes and devour the bonbons.</p>

<p>What riddles for the country boy! what dreads and pangs
for the philosopher who guessed that his manly dignity was
in as much danger in Luciennes as at Taverney.</p>

<p>Still he tried to talk to Zamore, but that interesting African,
sitting astride of a chair on casters, made it run him round
the room a dozen times with a celerity which ought to have
shown by anticipation that the velocipede was a practical machine.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bell tinkled and Zamore darted out of the room
with as much rapidity as he had shown on the novel quadricycle.</p>

<p>Gilbert would have followed, but on looking through the
doorway, he saw the passage so crowded with servants guard<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>ing
noblemen in gay clothes, that he shivered and slunk
back.</p>

<p>An hour passed, without the return of Zamore or Sylvie.
Gilbert was longing for human company, when a footman
came to take him to Mademoiselle Chon.</p>

<p>Free, after having informed her sister how she had conducted
the mission to Lady Bearn, Chon was breakfasting
with a hearty appetite, in a loose dressing-gown, in a morning
room. She cast a glance on Gilbert without offering him a
seat.</p>

<p>"How have you hit off with Zamore?" she inquired, after
tossing off a glass of wine like liquid topaz.</p>

<p>"How could I make the acquaintance of a black boy who
does not speak, but stares and gulps down candies?"</p>

<p>"I thought you said all were equal?"</p>

<p>"He may be my equal, but I do not think him so," answered
Gilbert.</p>

<p>"What fun he is!" muttered Chon: "you seem not to give
away your heart in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"With slowness, lady."</p>

<p>"I hoped you held me in affection?"</p>

<p>"I have considerable liking for you personally, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks for so much! You overpower me. How long
does it take for one to win the good graces of so disdainful a
fellow?"</p>

<p>"Much time; some would never win them."</p>

<p>"Ah, this explains why you could suddenly leave Taverney
Castle after staying there eighteen years. It appears that
its masters could not obtain your friendship and confidence?"</p>

<p>"Not all."</p>

<p>"What did they do? Who displeased you?"</p>

<p>"I am not complaining."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well! if you do not want to give your confidence.
I might help you to come out even with these Taverneys if
you told me what they are like."</p>

<p>"I take no revenge, or I take it with my own hand," said
Gilbert proudly.</p>

<p>"Still as you bear a grudge against them, or several, and
we have one, we ought to be allies."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, lady. I feel very different toward different
members of the family."</p>

<p>"Is Lord Philip one whom you paint black or rosy?"</p>

<p>"I bear no ill to Master Philip, who has done nothing to
me one way or another."</p>

<p>"Then you would not be a witness against him in favor of
my brother about that duel?"</p>

<p>"I should be bound to speak the truth, and that would be
unfavorable toward Chevalier Dubarry."</p>

<p>"Do you make him out wrong?"</p>

<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>

<p>"He was so, to insult the dauphiness."</p>

<p>"Are you upholding the dauphiness?"</p>

<p>"I stand for justice."</p>

<p>"You are mad, boy; never talk of justice in a royal residence.
When one serves a master, he takes the responsibility."</p>

<p>"Not so; every man should obey his conscience. Any way,
I have no master. I did not ask to come here, and now I will
go away, freely as I came."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you don't," cried Chon, amazed at this rebellion
and getting angered.</p>

<p>Gilbert frowned.</p>

<p>"No, no, let us have peace. Here you will have but three
persons to please. The king, my sister and myself."</p>

<p>"How am I to please you?"</p>

<p>"Well, you have seen Zamore? He gets already so much a
year out of the royal private purse; he is governor of
Luciennes, and though he may be laughed at for his blubber
lips and complexion, he is courted and called my lord."</p>

<p>"I shall not do that."</p>

<p>"What, when you assert that all men are brothers?"</p>

<p>"That is the reason why I will not acknowledge him my
lord."</p>

<p>Chon was beaten with her own weapons; she bit her lips.</p>

<p>"You do not seem to be ambitious?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," and his eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"To be a doctor? You shall be a doctor. That was the
costume you were measured for. Royal physician, too."</p>

<p>"I? who know not the A B C of medical science. You
are mocking at me, lady."</p>

<p>"Does Zamore know anything about governing a castle?"</p>

<p>"I see: you want me to be a sham doctor, a buffoon? The
king wants another merry-maker?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Don't you know that the Duke of Tresmes
begs my sister to appoint him her monkey. But don't hang
your head. Keep that lumpish air for your doctoral uniform.
Meanwhile, as you must live on something better than your
pills, go and have breakfast with the governor."</p>

<p>"With Zamore? I am not hungry."</p>

<p>"You will be before evening; if we must give you an
appetite, we will call in the whipper to the royal pages."</p>

<p>The youth trembled and turned pale.</p>

<p>"Go back to my Lord Zamore," continued Chon, taking
the silence for consent, or at least submission. "You will
find he is fed daintily. Mind not to be an ingrate, or you will
be taught what gratitude is."</p>

<p>A lackey conducted Gilbert to the mock governor's dining-room,
but he would not eat anything. Nevertheless, when
the costume of the doctor in Molière's comedy was brought,
he submitted to being shown how he was to wear it.</p>

<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>

<p>"I thought that the doctors of that time carried an inkhorn
and a quill to write out their prescriptions," suggested Gilbert.</p>

<p>"By Jove they did!" exclaimed the steward. "Let us
have the <a name="tn_png_115"></a><!--TN: Illegible word replaced with "****" on Page 113-->**** complete while we are about it."</p>

<p>The foreman charged to get the articles, also acquainted
Chon, who was going to join her sister in Paris, with the
astonishing willingness of her pet. She was so pleased that
she sent a little purse with some silver in it, to be added to the
doctor's girdle along with the inkhorn.</p>

<p>Gilbert sent his thanks, and expressed a wish to be left alone
to put on the costume.</p>

<p>"Make haste," said the steward, "that the young lady may
see you before she is off to Paris."</p>

<p>Gilbert looked out of the window to see how the gardens
were arranged. Returning to the table, he tore the long black
doctoral gown into three strips, which he made a rope of by
tying the ends together. On the table he laid the hat and
the purse and the following declaration which he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lady</span>: The foremost of boons is Liberty. The holiest
of duties is to preserve it. As you do violence to my feelings,
I set myself free. <span class="smcap alignright">Gilbert."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>He addressed this epistle to Chon, tied his twelve feet of
serge rope to the window sill, glided down like a serpent, and
dropped on the terrace at risk of breaking his neck. Though
stunned a little by the fall, he ran to some trees, scrambled
up among the boughs, slipped downward till he was on a
lower level and could reach the ground where he ran away
with all his might.</p>

<p>When they came for him half an hour after, he was far
beyond their reach.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE OLD BOTANIST.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">On</span> the trunk of a tree overthrown by a storm in
Meudon Woods a man was seated.</p>

<p>Under his grizzled wig he showed a mild and shrewd visage.
His brown coat was of good cloth, as were his breeches;
and his gray waistcoat was worked on the flaps. His gray
cotton stockings imprisoned well-made and muscular legs; his
buckled shoes, though dusty in patches, had been washed at
the top by the morning dews.</p>

<p>Near him, on the trunk, was a green box, open and
stuffed with freshly gathered plants. Between his legs he
held a cane with a crutch handle, ending in a sort of pick.</p>

<p>He was eating a piece of bread, and tossing crumbs to the
wild birds, which flew down on the pieces and took them off
to their nooks with joyful peeps.</p>

<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>

<p>Suddenly he heard hurried steps, and seeing on looking
up, a young man with disquieting aspect, he rose. He buttoned
up his coat and closed his overcoat above it.</p>

<p>His air was so calming that the intruder on his peace came
to a stop and doffed his hat.</p>

<p>It was Gilbert. Gilbert, much the worse for his roaming
the woods through the night since he had fled from Luciennes
in order not to lose his freedom.</p>

<p>Remarking this sudden timidity, the old man appeared to
be put at ease by it.</p>

<p>"Do you want to speak to me, my friend?" he asked, smiling,
and laying the piece of bread on the tree.</p>

<p>"Yes, for I see that you are throwing away bread on the
birds as though it were not written that the Lord provides
for the sparrows."</p>

<p>"The Lord provides," returned the old gentleman, "no
doubt, young man; but the hand of man is one of the means.
You are wrong if you said that as a reproach, for never is
cast-away bread&mdash;in the desert or on the crowded street&mdash;lost
to living creatures. Here, the birds get it; there, the beggars."</p>

<p>"Though this be the wilds, I know of a man who wants to
dispute that bread with the birds," said Gilbert, though struck
by the soft and penetrating voice of the stranger.</p>

<p>"Are you the man&mdash;and are you hungered?"</p>

<p>"Sharply so, and if you would allow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With eager compassion the gentleman took up the crust,
but, suddenly reflecting, he scrutinized Gilbert with a quick
yet profound glance.</p>

<p>Gilbert was not so like a starving man that the meditation
was warranted. His dress was decent, though earth-stained in
places. His linen was white, for he had at Versailles, on the
previous evening, changed his shirt out of his parcel; but
from its dampness, it was visible that he had slept in the
woods. In all this and his white and taper hands, the man of
vague reverie was revealed rather than the hard worker.</p>

<p>Not wanting for tact, Gilbert understood the distrust and
hesitation of the stranger in respect to him, and hastened to
annul conjectures which might be unfavorable.</p>

<p>"After twelve hours, hunger begins, and I have eaten
nothing for four-and-twenty," he observed.</p>

<p>The truth of the words was supported by his emotion, the
quaver of his voice and the pallor of his face. The old gentleman
therefore ceased to waver, or rather to fear. He held out
not only the bread, but a handkerchief in which he was carrying
cherries.</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Gilbert, repulsing the fruit gently;
"only the bread, which is ample."</p>

<p>Breaking the crust in two, he took one portion and pushed
back the other. Then he sat on the grass, a yard or two away<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>
from the old gentlemen, who viewed him with increasing
wonder. The meal did not last long, as the bread was scant
and Gilbert hungry. With no words did the observer trouble
him, but continued his mute and furtive examination while
apparently only attending to his plants and flowers in the
box.</p>

<p>But seeing that Gilbert was going to drink at a pool, he
quickly called out:</p>

<p>"Do not drink that water, young man. It is infected by
the detritus of the plants dead last year and by the frog-spawn
swimming on the surface. You had better take some
cherries, as they will quench thirst better than water. I
invite you to partake as I see you are not an importunate
guest."</p>

<p>"It is true, sir; importunity is the opposite of my nature.
I fear nothing so much as being importunate, as I have just
been proving at Versailles."</p>

<p>"Oh! so you come from Versailles?" queried the stranger,
looking hard at him. "A rich place, where only the proud
or the poor die of want."</p>

<p>"I am both, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you quarreled with your master?"</p>

<p>"I have no master."</p>

<p>"That is a very lofty answer," said the other, putting away
the plants in the box, while regarding the young man.</p>

<p>"Still it is exact."</p>

<p>"No, young man, for everybody has a master here, as we all
suffer the domination of a higher power. Some are ruled by
men, some by principles: and the sternest masters are not
always those who order or strike with the human voice or
hand."</p>

<p>"I confess I am ruled by principles," replied Gilbert. "They
are the only masters which the mind may acknowledge without
shame."</p>

<p>"Oh, those are your principles, are they? You seem very
young to have any settled principles."</p>

<p>"I am young but I have studied, or rather read a little in
such works as 'On the Inequality of Classes,' and 'The Social
Contract;' out of them comes all my knowledge, and perhaps
all my dreams."</p>

<p>These words kindled a flame in the hearer's eyes; he so
started that he broke a flower rebellious to being packed away.</p>

<p>"These may not be your principles, but they are Rousseau's."</p>

<p>"Dry stuff for a youth," said the other; "sad matter for
contemplation at twenty years of age; a dry and scentless
flower for imagination in the springtide of life."</p>

<p>"Misfortune ripens a man unseasonably, sir."</p>

<p>"As you study the philosopher of Geneva, do you make a
personal allusion there?"</p>

<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>

<p>"I do not know anything about him," rejoined Gilbert,
candidly.</p>

<p>"Know, young man, that he is an unhappy creature."
With a sigh he said it.</p>

<p>"Impossible! Jean Jacques Rousseau unhappy? Is there
no justice above more than on earth? The man unhappy
who has consecrated his life to the welfare of the race."</p>

<p>"I plainly see that you do not know him; so let us rather
speak of yourself. Whither are you going?"</p>

<p>"To Paris. Do you belong there?"</p>

<p>"So far as I am living there, but I was not born in it.
Why the question?"</p>

<p>"It is attached to the subject we were talking of; if you
live in Paris, you may have seen the Philosopher Rousseau."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have seen him."</p>

<p>"He is looked at as he passes along&mdash;they point to him as
the benefactor of humanity?"</p>

<p>"No; the children follow him, and, encouraged by their
parents, throw stones at him."</p>

<p>"Gracious! still he has the consolation of being rich," said
Gilbert, with painful stupefaction.</p>

<p>"Like yourself, he often wonders where the next meal is
coming from."</p>

<p>"But, though poor, he is powerful, respected and well considered?"</p>

<p>"He does not know of a night, in lying down, that he will
not wake in the Bastille."</p>

<p>"How he must hate men!"</p>

<p>"He neither loves not hates them: they fill him with disgust,
that is all."</p>

<p>"I do not understand how he can not hate those who ill
use him," exclaimed Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Rousseau has always been free, and strong enough to
rely on himself. Strength and liberty make men meek and
good; it is only weakness and slavery which create the
wicked."</p>

<p>"I guessed this as you explain it; and that is why I wished
to be free." I see that we agree on one point, our liking for
Rousseau.</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself, young man: youth is the season for
illusions."</p>

<p>"Nay; one may be deceived upon things, but not on men."</p>

<p>"Alas, you will learn by and by, that it is men particularly
about whom deception is easiest. Perhaps Rousseau is a little
fairer than other men; but he has his faults, and great
ones."</p>

<p>Gilbert shook his head, but the stranger continued to treat
him with the same favor, though he was so uncivil.</p>

<p>"You said you had no master?"</p>

<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>

<p>"None, though it dwelt with me to have a most illustrious
one; but I refused on the condition that I should make
the amusement of noble idlers. Being young, able to study
and make my way, I ought not to lose the precious time of
youth and compromise in my person the dignity of man."</p>

<p>"This was right," said the stranger gravely; <a name="tn_png_119"></a><!--TN: Quote added before "but" on Page 117-->"but have you
determined on a career?"</p>

<p>"I should like to be a physician."</p>

<p>"A grand and noble career, where one may decide between
true science, modest and martyr-like, and quackery, impudent,
rich and bloated. If you love truth, young man, be a doctor. If
you love popular applause, be a doctor."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it will cost a lot of money to study, although
Rousseau learned for nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing? oh, young man," said the plant-collector, with
a mournful smile, "do you call nothing the most precious of
heavenly blessings&mdash;candor, health and sleep? That was the
price the Genevian seeker of wisdom paid for the little he
<a name="tn_png_119a"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "knows." on Page 117-->knows."</p>

<p>"Little! when he is a great musical composer!"</p>

<p>"Pooh, because the king sings 'I have lost my servant,'
that does not prove 'The Village Sorcerer' to be a good
opera."</p>

<p>"He is a noted botanist!"</p>

<p>"An herb-gatherer, very humble and ignorant amid the marvels
known as plants and flowers."</p>

<p>"He is a Latin scholar, for I read that he had translated
Tacitus."</p>

<p>"Bah, because in his conceit he wanted to be master of all
crafts. But Tacitus, who is a rough antagonist to wrestle
with, tired him. No, no, my good young man, in spite of
your admiration, there are no more Admirable Crichtons, and
what man gains in breadth he loses in depth. Rousseau is a
superficial man whose surface is a trifle wider than most
men's, that is all."</p>

<p>"Many would like to attain his mark," said the youth.</p>

<p>"Do you slur at me?" asked the stranger with a good
nature disarming Gilbert.</p>

<p>"God forbid, for it is too much pleasure to chat for me to
disoblige you. You draw me out and I am amazed at the language
I am using, for I only picked it out of books, which I
did not clearly follow. I have read too much, but I will read
again with care. But I forget that while your talk is valuable
to me, mine only wastes your time, for you are herb-gathering."</p>

<p>"No," said the botanist, fixing his gray eyes on the youth,
who made a move to go but wanted to be detained. "My
box is clearly full and I only want certain mosses; I heard
that capillary grows round here."</p>

<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>

<p>"Stay, I saw some yonder."</p>

<p>"How do you know capillarys?"</p>

<p>"I was born on the woodland; the daughter of the nobleman
on whose estate I was reared, liked botany; she had a
collection and the objects had their names on labels attached.
I noticed that what she called capillary was called by us
rustics maidenhair fern."</p>

<p>"So you took a taste for botany?"</p>

<p>"It was this way. I sometimes heard Nicole&mdash;she is the maid
to Mademoiselle Andrea de Taverney&mdash;say that her mistress
wanted such and such a plant for her herbarium, so I asked
her to get a sketch of them, and I searched in the woods till
I raked them up. Then I transplanted them where she must
find them, and used to hear the lady, in taking her walk, cry
out: 'How odd! here is the very thing I was looking <a name="tn_png_120"></a><!--TN: Single quote added after "for!" on Page 118-->for!'"</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked with more heed and it made Gilbert
lower his eyes blushing, for the interest had tenderness
in it.</p>

<p>"Continue to study botany, which leads as a flowery path
to medicine. Paris has free schools, and I suppose your
folks will supply your maintenance."</p>

<p>"I have no relations, but I can earn my living at some
trade."</p>

<p>"Yes, Rousseau says in his 'Emile,' that every one should
learn a trade even though he were a prince's son."</p>

<p>"I have not read that book, but I have heard Baron Taverney
mock at the maxim, and pretend grief at not having
made his son a joiner. Instead, he made him a soldier, so
that he will dismember instead of joining."</p>

<p>"Yes, these nobles bring their sons up to kill and not to
nourish. When revolution comes, they will be forced to beg
their bread abroad or sell their sword to the foreigners, which
is more shameful. But you are not noble, and you have a
craft?"</p>

<p>"No, I have a horror for rough toil; but give me a study
and see how I will wear out night and day in my tasks."</p>

<p>"You have been to school, if not to college?"</p>

<p>"I know but to read and write," said Gilbert, shaking his
head. "My mother taught me to read, for seeing me slight
in physique, she said, 'You will never be a good workman,
but must try to be priest or scholar. Learn to read, Gilbert,
and you will not have to split wood, guide the plow or hew
stone.' Unhappily my mother died before I could more than
read, so I taught myself writing. First I traced letters on
sand with a sharp stick till I found that the letters used in
writing were not those of print, which I was copying.
Hence I hope to meet some one who will need my pen, a
blind man who will need my eyes, or a dumby who needs
my tongue."</p>

<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>

<p>"You appear to have willingness and courage; but do you
know what it will cost you to live in town?&mdash;at least three
times what it did in the country."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose I have shelter and for rest after toil, I can
shift on six cents a day."</p>

<p>"That is the right talk. I like this kind of man," said the
plant collector. "Come with me to Paris and I will find you
an independent profession by which you may live."</p>

<p>"Oh, my friend," exclaimed Gilbert, intoxicated with delight.
"I accept your offer and I am grateful. But what
will I have to do in your company?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but toil. But you will mete out the amount of
your work. You will exercise your right of youth, freedom,
happiness and even of idleness after you earn the right to be at
leisure," added the unnamed benefactor, smiling as though in
spite of his will.</p>

<p>Then, raising his eyes to heaven, he ejaculated: "Oh,
youth, vigor and liberty!" with an inexpressibly poetical melancholy
spreading over his fine, pure lineaments.</p>

<p>"Now, lead me to the spot where the maidenhair is to be
found," he said.</p>

<p>Gilbert stepped out before the old gentleman and the pair
disappeared in the underwood.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">MASTER JACQUES.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Before</span> the day was over the pair could enter the capital.
The young man's heart beat as he perceived Notre Dame
Cathedral towers and the ocean of housetops.</p>

<p>"Oh, Paris!" he cried with rapture.</p>

<p>"Yes, Paris, a mass of buildings, a gulf of evils," said the
old gentleman. "On each stone yonder you would see a
drop of blood or a tear, if the miseries within those abodes
could show themselves without."</p>

<p>Gilbert repressed his enthusiasm, which cooled of itself.</p>

<p>They entered by a poor district and the sights were hideous.</p>

<p>"It is going on eight," said the conductor, "let us be quick,
young man, for goodness' sake."</p>

<p>Gilbert hurried on.</p>

<p>"I forget to say that I am a married man," said the
stranger, after a cold silence which began to worry the youth.
"And my wife, who is a genuine Parisian, will probably
grumble at our coming home late. Besides, she does not like
strangers. Still, I have invited you; so, come along. Or,
rather, here we are."</p>

<p>By the last sunbeams, Gilbert, looking up, saw the name-plate
of Plastrière Street at a corner.</p>

<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>

<p>The other paused before an alley door with iron bars to the
upper portion. He pulled a leather thong hanging out of a
hole, and this opened the door.</p>

<p>"Come quickly," he called to the youth, who hesitated on
the threshold, and he closed the alley door after them.</p>

<p>At the end of a few steps up the dark passage, Gilbert
stumbled on the lower step of a black, steep flight of stairs.
Used to the locality, the old <a name="tn_png_122"></a><!--TN: "gentlemen" changed to "gentleman" on Page 120-->gentleman had gone up a dozen
steps. Gilbert rejoined him and stopped only when he did, on a
landing worn by feet, on which opened two doors. The
stranger pulled a hare's foot hanging at one, and a shrill bell
tinkled inside the room.</p>

<p>A woman some fifty years of age appeared, and she and the
man spoke together:</p>

<p>"Is it very late, Therese?" asked the latter <a name="tn_png_122a"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period added after "timidly" on Page 120-->timidly.</p>

<p>"A nice hour to come to supper, Jacques!" snarled the
woman.</p>

<p>"Come, come, we will make up for the delay," said the one
called Jacques, shutting the door and taking the collecting
case from Gilbert's hands.</p>

<p>"Have we a messenger boy here?" exclaimed the old
woman: "We only wanted him to complete the merry company.
So you can no longer do so much as carry your heap
of weeds and grass? Master Jacques does the grand with a
boy to carry his trash&mdash;I beg his pardon, he is becoming quite
a great nobleman."</p>

<p>"Be a little quiet, Therese."</p>

<p>"Pay the boy and get rid of him; we want no spies here."</p>

<p>Pale as death, Gilbert sprang toward the door, but Jacques
stopped him, saying with some firmness:</p>

<p>"This is not a messenger-boy or a spy. He is a guest whom
I bring home."</p>

<p>"A guest?" and the hag let her hands drop along her hips.
"This is the last straw."</p>

<p>"Light <a name="tn_png_122b"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "up," and placed after "Therese," on Page 120-->up, Therese," said the host, still kindly, but showing
more will; "I am warm, and we are hungry."</p>

<p>The vixen's grumbling diminished in loudness. She drew
fire with flint and steel, while Gilbert stood still by the sill
which he regretted he had crossed. Jacques perceived what
he suffered, and begged him to come forward.</p>

<p>Gilbert saw the hag's yellow and morose face by the first
glimmer of the thin candle stuck in a brass candlestick. It
inspired him with dislike. On her part the virago was far
from liking the pale, fine countenance, circumspect silence
and rigidity of the youth.</p>

<p>"I do not wonder at your being heated and hungry," she
growled. "It must be tiresome to go browsing in the woods,
and it is awful hard work to stoop from time to time to pick
up a root. For I suppose this person gathers leaves and buds,<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>
too, for herb-collecting is the trade for those who do not any
work."</p>

<p>"This is a good and honest young man," said Jacques, in a
still firmer voice, "who has honored me with his company
all day, and whom my good Therese will greet as a friend, I
am sure."</p>

<p>"Enough for two is scant for three," she grumbled.</p>

<p>"We are both frugal."</p>

<p>"I know your kind of frugality. I declare that there is not
enough bread in the house for such abstemiousness, and that I
am not going down three flights of stairs for more. Anyway,
the baker's is shut up."</p>

<p>"Then, I will go," said Jacques, frowning. "Open the
door, for I mean it."</p>

<p>"Oh, in that case, I suppose I must do it," said the scold.</p>

<p>"What am I for but to carry out your freaks? Come and
have supper."</p>

<p>A table was set in the next room, small and square, with
cherry wood chairs, having straw bottoms, and a bureau full
of darned hose.</p>

<p>Gilbert took a chair; the old woman placed a plate and the
appurtenances, all worn with hard use, before him, with a
pewter goblet.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going after bread?" said Jacques.</p>

<p>"Never mind; I found a roll in the cupboard, and you
ought to manage on a pound and a half of bread, eh?"</p>

<p>So saying, she put the soup on the board. All three had
good appetites, but Gilbert held in his, but he was the first to
get through.</p>

<p>"Who has called to-day?" inquired the host, to change the
termagant's ideas.</p>

<p>"The whole world, as usual. You promised Lady Boufflers
four quires of music, Lady Escars two arias, and Lady Penthievre
a quartet with accompaniment. They came or sent.
But the ladies must go without their music because our lord
was out plucking dandelions."</p>

<p>Jacques did not show anger, though Gilbert expected him to
do so, for he was used to this manner. The soup was followed
by a chunk of boiled beef, on a delft plate grooved with knife
points. The host served Gilbert scantily, as Therese was
watching, took the same sized piece and passed the plate to his
Xantippe.</p>

<p>She handed a slice of bread to the guest. It was so small
that Jacques blushed, but he waited until she had helped him
and herself, when he took the loaf from her. He handed it
to Gilbert and bade him cut off according to his wants.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Gilbert, as some beans in butter were
served, "but I have no longer any hunger. I never eat but
one dish. And I drink only water."</p>

<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>

<p>Jacques had a little wine for himself.</p>

<p>"You must see about the young man's bed," said the latter,
putting down the bottle. "He must be tired."</p>

<p>Therese dropped her fork and stared at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Sleep here? you must be mad. Bring people home to sleep&mdash;I
expect you want to give up your own bed to them. You
must be off your head. Is it keeping a lodging-house you are
about? If this is so, don't look to me! get a cook and servants.
It is bad enough to be yours, without waiting on Tom, Dick
and Harry."</p>

<p>"Therese, listen to me," replied Jacques, with his grave,
even voice; "it is for one night only. This young man has
never set foot in Paris, and comes under my safe-conduct. I
am not going to have him go to an inn, though he has to
have my own bed, look you."</p>

<p>Therese understood that struggle was out of the question for
the present and she changed her tactics by fighting for Gilbert,
but as an ally who would stab him in the back at the
first chance.</p>

<p>"I daresay you know all about him, or you would not
have brought him home, and he ought to stay here. I will
shake up some kind of a bed in your study among the papers."</p>

<p>"No, no, a study is not fit for a sleeping-room; a light
might set fire to the writings."</p>

<p>"Which would be no loss," sneered Therese.</p>

<p>"There is the garret; the room with a fine outlook over
such gardens as are scarce in Paris. Have no anxiety, Therese;
the young man will not be a burden; he will earn his own
living. Take a candle and follow me."</p>

<p>Therese sighed, but she was mastered. Gilbert gravely rose
and followed his benefactor. On the landing Gilbert saw
drinking water in a tank.</p>

<p>"Is water dear in town?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"They charge for it; but any way, bread and water are
two things which man has no right to refuse to his fellow-man."</p>

<p>"But at Taverney, water ran freely, and the luxury of the
poor is cleanliness."</p>

<p>"Take as much as you like, my friend," said Master
Jacques.</p>

<p>Gilbert filled a crock and followed the host, who was astonished
at so young a man allying the firmness of the people
with the instinct of the aristocratic.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">IN THE LOFT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">To</span> tell the truth, the loft where Jacques stowed his guest
was not fit for habitation. The mattress was on the floor and<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>
the chief article of furniture. Rats had pulled about and
gnawed a heap of yellowed papers. On clotheslines across
the attic were paper bags in which were drying beans, herbs
and household linen.</p>

<p>"It is not nice to look upon," apologized the host, "but
sleep and darkness make the sumptuous palace and the meanest
cottage much alike. Sleep as youth can do, and nothing
will prevent you thinking you slept in the royal palace. But
mind you do not set the house afire. We will talk over matters
in the morning."</p>

<p>"Good-night and hearty thanks," said Gilbert, left alone in
the garret.</p>

<p>With all the precaution recommended, he took up the light
and made the rounds of the room. As the newspapers and
pamphlets were tied in bales he did not open them; but the
bean bags were made of printed pages of a book, which
caught his eye with the lines. One sack, knocked off the line
by his head, burst on the floor, and in trying to replace the
beans, he fell to reading the wrappers. It was a page from
the love of a poor youth for a lovely and fashionable lady
named Lady Warrens. Gilbert was congratulating himself
on having the whole night to read this love story on the
wrappers when the candle went out and left him in gloom.
He was ready to weep with rage. He dropped the papers on
the heap of beans and flung himself on his couch where he
slept deeply in spite of his disappointment.</p>

<p>He was roused only by the grating of the lock. It was
bright day; Gilbert saw his host gently enter.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he muttered, with the red of shame on
his cheeks as he saw Jacques staring at the beans and emptied
bags.</p>

<p>"Did you sleep soundly?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es."</p>

<p>"Nay, are you not a sleep-walker?"</p>

<p>"Alas, I see why you say that. I sat up reading till the
candle was burnt out, from the first sheet on which my eyes
fell so greatly interesting me. Do you, who know so much,
know to what lovely novel those pages belong?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, but as I notice the word 'Confessions' on
the headline, I should think it was Memoirs."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, the man so speaking is not doing so of himself; the
avowals are too frank&mdash;the opinions too impartial."</p>

<p>"I think you are wrong," said the old gentleman quickly.
"The author wanted to set an example of showing himself to
his fellows as heaven created him."</p>

<p>"Do you know the author?"</p>

<p>"The writer is Jean Jacques Rousseau. These are stray
pages out of his 'Confessions.'"</p>

<p>"So this unknown, poor, obscure youth, almost begging<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
his way afoot on the highroads, was the man who was to
write 'Emile' and the 'Social Contract?'"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;or, rather no!" said the other with unspeakable sadness.
"This author is the man disenchanted with life, glory,
society and almost with heaven; but the other Rousseau,
Lady Warrens', was the youth entering life by the same door
as Aurora comes into the world; youth with his joys and
hopes. An abyss divides the two Rousseaus thirty years wide."</p>

<p>The old gentleman shook his head, let his arms sadly droop,
and appeared to sink into deep musing.</p>

<p>"So," went on Gilbert, "it is possible for the meanly born
like Rousseau to win the love of a mighty and beautiful lady?
This is calculated to drive those mad who have lifted their
eyes to those above their sphere."</p>

<p>"Are you in love and do you see some likeness between
your case and Rousseau's?" asked the old gentleman.</p>

<p>Gilbert blushed without answering the question.</p>

<p>"But he won, because he was Rousseau," he observed.
"Yet, were I to feel a spark of his flame of genius, I should
aspire to the star, and seek to wear it even though&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You had to commit a crime?"</p>

<p>Jacques started and cut short the interview by saying:</p>

<p>"I think my wife must be up. We will go down stairs. Besides,
a working day never begins too soon. Come, young
man, come."</p>

<p>On going forth, Jacques secured the garret door with a padlock.</p>

<p>This time he guided his ward into what Therese called the
study. The furniture of this little room was composed of
glazed cases of butterflies, herbs and minerals, framed in
ebonized wood; books in a walnut case, a long, narrow table,
covered with a worn and blackened cloth; with manuscripts
orderly arranged on it, and four wooden chairs covered in
horsehair. All was glossy, lustrous, irreproachable in order
and cleanness, but cold to sight and heart, from the light
through the gauze curtains being gray and weak, and luxury,
or comfort itself, being far from this cold, ashy and black fireside.</p>

<p>A small rosewood piano stood on four legs, and a clock on
the mantel-piece alone showed any life in this domestic tomb.</p>

<p>Gilbert walked in respectfully, for it was grand in his eyes;
almost as rich as Taverney, and the waxed floor imposed on
him.</p>

<p>"I am going to show you the nature of your work," said the
old gentleman. "This is music paper. When I copy a page
I earn ten cents, the price I myself fix. Do you know
music?"</p>

<p>"I know the names of the notes but not their value, as well
as these signs. In the house where I lived was a young lady<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>
who played the harpsichord&mdash;&mdash;" and Gilbert hung his head,
coloring.</p>

<p>"Oh, the same who studied botany," queried Jacques.</p>

<p>"Precisely; and she played very well."</p>

<p>"This does not account for your learning music."</p>

<p>"Rousseau says that the man is incomplete who enjoys a
result without seeking the cause."</p>

<p>"Yes; but, also, that man in perfecting himself by the
discovery, loses his happiness, freshness and instincts."</p>

<p>"What matter if what he gains compensates him for the
losses?"</p>

<p>"Gad! you are not only a botanist and a musician, but a
logician. At present we only require a copyist. While copying,
you will train your hand to write more easily when you
compose for yourself. Meanwhile, with a couple of hours'
copy work at night, you may earn the wherewithal to
follow the courses in the colleges of medicine, surgery and
botany."</p>

<p>"I understand you," exclaimed Gilbert, "and I thank you
from the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>He settled himself to begin work on the sheet of paper held
out by the kind gentleman.</p>




<hr style="width:65%;">

<span class="chapterhead">WHO MASTER JACQUES WAS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">While</span> the novice was covering the paper with his first attempts,
the old gentleman set to reading printer's proofs&mdash;long
leaves blank on one side like the paper of which was
made the bean bags.</p>

<p>At nine Therese rushed in.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick!" she cried to Jacques, who raised his head.
"Come out. It is a prince who calls. Goodness me! when
will this procession of high-cockalorums cease? I hope this
one will not take it into his head to have breakfast with us,
like the Duke of Chartres the other day."</p>

<p>"Which prince is this one?" asked Jacques in an undertone.</p>

<p>"His Highness the Prince of Conti."</p>

<p>Gilbert let a blob of ink fall on the paper much more resembling
a blot than a full note.</p>

<p>Jacques went out, smiling behind Therese, who shut the
door after them.</p>

<p>"Princes here!" thought Gilbert. "Dukes calling on a
copier of music!"</p>

<p>With his heart singularly beating, he went up to the door
to listen.</p>

<p>"I want to take you with me," said a strange voice.</p>

<p>"For what purpose, prince?" inquired Jacques.</p>

<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>

<p>"To present you to the dauphiness. A new era opens for
philosophers in her coming reign."</p>

<p>"I am a thousand times thankful to your highness; but my
infirmities keep me indoors."</p>

<p>"And your misanthropy?"</p>

<p>"Suppose it were that? Is it so curious a thing that I should
put myself out for it?"</p>

<p>"Come, and I will spare you the grand reception at the
celebration at St. Denis, and take you on to Muette, where her
royal highness will pass the night in a couple of days."</p>

<p>"Does she get to St. Denis the day after to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"With her whole retinue. Come! the princess is a pupil of
Gluck and an excellent musician."</p>

<p>Gilbert did not listen to any more after hearing that the
dauphiness' retinue would be at St. Denis, only a few miles
out, in a day or two. He might soon be within view of Andrea.
This idea dazzled him like a flash from a looking-glass
in his face. When he opened his eyes after this giddiness they
fell on a book which happened to be open on the sideboard;
it was Rousseau's <i>Confessions</i>, "adorned with a portrait of
the author."</p>

<p>"The very thing I was looking for. I had never seen what
he was like."</p>

<p>He quickly turned over the tissue paper on the steel plate
and as he looked, the door opened and the living original of
the portrait returned. With extended hands, dropping the
volume, and trembling all over, he muttered:</p>

<p>"Oh! I am under the roof of Jean Jacques Rousseau!"</p>

<p>The old gentleman smiled with more happiness at this unstudied
ovation than at the thousand triumphs of his glorious
life.</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend, you are in Rousseau's house."</p>

<p>"Pray forgive me for the nonsense I have talked," said the
hero-worshiper, clasping his hands and about to fall on his
knees.</p>

<p>"Did it require a prince's call for you to recognize the persecuted
philosopher of Geneva? poor child&mdash;but lucky one&mdash;who
is ignorant of persecution."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am happy to see you, to know you, to dwell by you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is all very well; but we must earn our living.
When you shall have copied this piece&mdash;for you have
practiced enough to make a start&mdash;you will have earned your
keep to-day. I charge nothing for the lodging&mdash;only do not
sit up late and burn up the candles, for Therese will scold.
What was left over from supper last night will be our breakfast;
but this will be the last meal we take together, unless I
invite you. In the street is a cheap dining-house for artisans,
where you will fare nicely. I recommend it. In the mean
time, let us breakfast."</p>

<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>

<p>Gilbert followed without a word, for he was conquered, for
the first time; but then this was a man superior to others.</p>

<p>After the first mouthfuls he left table; the shock had spoilt
his appetite. At eight in the evening he had copied a piece of
music, not artistically but legibly, and Rousseau paid him the
six cents.</p>

<p>"We have plenty of bread," remarked Therese, on whom
the young man's gentleness, application and discretion had
produced good effect.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget your kindness, madame," he said,
about to excuse himself, when he caught the host's eye and
guessed that it would offend him.</p>

<p>"I accept," he said.</p>

<p>He went up to his loft, with the bread and money.</p>

<p>"At last I am my own master," he said to himself, "or
should be but for this bread, which is from charity."</p>

<p>Although hungry, he placed it on the window sill and did
not touch it during the night, though famine made him remember
it.</p>

<p>He woke up at daylight, but still he did not eat the bread.
He took it up, though, and at five o'clock, went down and
outdoors.</p>

<p>From suspicion, or merely to study his guest, Rousseau was
on the lookout, and he followed the youth up the street.</p>

<p>A beggar coming up to Gilbert, he gave him the hunk of
bread. Entering the baker's, he bought another roll.</p>

<p>"He is going into the eating-house," thought the watcher,
"where the money will soon fly."</p>

<p>But Gilbert munched part of the roll while strolling; he
washed down the rest at the public fountain, washed his
hands and sauntered home.</p>

<p>"By my faith, I believe that I am happier than Diogenes
and have found an honest man," thought Rousseau.</p>

<p>The day passed in uninterrupted labor. At even Gilbert
had turned out seven pages of copy&mdash;if not elegant, faultless.
He tested in his hand the money received for it with ardent
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You are my master," he said, "since I find work in your
place and you give me lodgings gratis. I should therefore
lay myself open to be badly thought of by you if I acted without
consulting you."</p>

<p>"What," said Rousseau, frightened; "what are you going
to do? Going off elsewhere to work?"</p>

<p>"No, only I want a holiday, with your leave, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To idle?"</p>

<p>"No, to go to St. Denis to see the dauphiness arrive."</p>

<p>"I thought you scorned the pomps of this worldly show,"
said Rousseau. "I, though an obscure citizen, despised the
invitation of these great people to be of the reception party."</p>

<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>

<p>Gilbert nodded approval.</p>

<p>"I am not philosophic," said he, "but I am discreet."</p>

<p>This word struck the tutor, who saw there was some mystery
in this behavior, and he looked at the speaker with admiration.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you have a motive."</p>

<p>"Yes, and one which does not resemble the curiosity of a
man at a show."</p>

<p>"It is for the better, or for the worse, for your look is deep,
young man, and I seek in it in vain for youthful calm and
candor."</p>

<p>"I told you I was unfortunate," returned Gilbert; "and
such have no youth."</p>

<p>"But at the hour when you are seeing all the pomps of
society glitter before you, I shall open one of my herbariums
and review the magnificence of nature."</p>

<p>"But would you not have turned your back on herbariums
if you were going to see your sweetheart&mdash;the one to whom
you tossed a bunch of cherries?"</p>

<p>"Quite true! And you are young. Go to the show, my
boy. It is not ambition in him, but love," he commented
when Gilbert had gone out gleefully.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">OLD PATRICIANS AND NEW.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">When</span> the news spread of the royal splendor over the reception
of the bride from Austria, the dreadful curiosity of
the Parisians was sharpened, and they were to be seen flocking
out to St. Denis by scores, hundreds and thousands.</p>

<p>Gilbert was lost in the multitude, but, seeing some urchins
climb up in the trees, and the exercise being child's play to
him, he clambered into a linn tree and perched on a bough
to wait.</p>

<p>Half an hour after, drums beat, cannon thundered, and the
majestic cathedral bell began to boom.</p>

<p>In the distance a shrill cry arose, but became full and more
deep as it drew near. It made Gilbert prick up the ear and
his whole body quiver.</p>

<p>"Long life to the king!"</p>

<p>It was the customary cheer.</p>

<p>A herd of horses, neighing under housings of gold and purple,
swarmed on the highway; they were the royal household
troops, guards, Swiss dragoons, musketeers and gendarmes.</p>

<p>Then a massive and magnificent coach loomed up.</p>

<p>Gilbert perceived a stately head under a hat, when all were
uncovered, and a blue sash. He saw the royal glance, cold
and penetrative, before which all bowed and heads were
bared. Fascinated, intoxicated, panting and frozen, he for<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>got
to lift his hat. A violent blow drew him from his
ecstasy; his hat had been knocked off with the stroke of a soldier's
halberd.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," he stammered. "I am fresh from the
country."</p>

<p>"Then learn that you must salute all the royal carriages,
whoever may be in <a name="tn_png_131"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "them," on Page 129-->them," said the halberdier gruffly. "If
you do not know the emblem of the lilyflower, I will teach
you."</p>

<p>"You need not. I know," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>The royal equipages passed in a prolonged line. Gilbert
gazed on them so intently that he seemed stupefied.</p>

<p>At the Royal Abbey doors they stopped successively to let
the noblemen and ladies alight. These setting-down movements
caused halts of a few minutes.</p>

<p>In one of them Gilbert felt a burning dart rush through his
heart.</p>

<p>He was dazzled so that all was effaced in his sight, and so
violent a shivering overwhelmed him that he was forced to
catch at the branch not to tumble off.</p>

<p>Right in front of him, not ten paces off, in one of the vehicles
with the lily brand which he had been advised to salute,
he perceived the splendidly luminous face of Andrea Taverney;
she was clad in white, like an angel or a ghost.</p>

<p>He uttered a faint outcry; but then, triumphing over the
emotions which had mastered him together, he commanded
his heart to cease to beat that he might look at the star.</p>

<p>Such was the young man's power over himself that he succeeded.</p>

<p>Wishful to learn why the horses had been reined in,
Andrea leaned out, and, as her bright blue eyes traveled
round, she caught sight of Gilbert and recognized him.</p>

<p>Gilbert suspected that she would be surprised and would
inform her father of the discovery, as he sat next her.</p>

<p>He was not wrong, for Andrea called the baron's attention
to the youth.</p>

<p>"Gilbert," said the nobleman, who was puffing himself up
at the coach window, in his handsome red sash of the order
of knighthood. "He, here? Who is taking care of my hound,
then?"</p>

<p>Hearing the words, the young man respectfully bowed to
Andrea and her father. But it took him all his powers to
make the effort.</p>

<p>"It is so. It is the rascal in person," said the baron.</p>

<p>On Andrea's face, observed by Gilbert with sustained attention,
was perfect calm under slight surprise.</p>

<p>Leaning out of the carriage, the baron beckoned to his ex-retainer.
But the soldier who had given the youth a lesson
in etiquette stopped him.</p>

<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>

<p>"Let the lad come to me," said the lord; "I have a couple
of words to say to him."</p>

<p>"You may go half a dozen, my lord," said the sergeant,
flattered by the nobleman addressing him; "plenty of time,
for they are speechifying under the porch. Pass, younker."</p>

<p>"Come hither, rogue," said the baron on Gilbert affecting
not to hurry himself out of his usual walk. "Tell me by what
chance you are out here at St. Denis when you ought to be at
Taverney?"</p>

<p>"It is no chance," replied Gilbert, saluting lord and lady
for the second time, "but the act of my free will."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by your will, varlet? Have you such
a thing as a will of your own?"</p>

<p>"Why not? <a name="tn_png_132"></a><!--TN: "every" changed to "Every" on Page 130-->Every free man has his own."</p>

<p>"Free man? Do you fancy yourself free, you unhappy
dog?"</p>

<p>"Of course, since I parted with my freedom to no one."</p>

<p>"On my word, here's a pretty knave," said the baron, taken
aback by the coolness of the speaker. "How dare you be in
town, and how did you manage to get here?"</p>

<p>"I walked it," said Gilbert shortly.</p>

<p>"Walked!" repeated Andrea with some pity.</p>

<p>"But I ask what you have come here for?" continued the
baron.</p>

<p>"To get an education, which is assured me, and make my
fortune, which I hope for."</p>

<p>"What are you doing meanwhile&mdash;begging?"</p>

<p>"Begging?" reiterated Gilbert, with superb scorn.</p>

<p>"Thieving, then?"</p>

<p>"I never stole anything from Taverney," retorted Gilbert,
with such proud and wild firmness that it riveted the girl's
attention on him for a space.</p>

<p>"What mischief does your idle hand find to do, then?"</p>

<p>"What a genius is doing, whom I seek to resemble if only
by perseverance; I copy music," replied the rebel.</p>

<p>"You copy music?" queried Andrea, turning round.
"Then you know it?" in the tone of one saying, "You are a
liar."</p>

<p>"I know the notes, and that is enough for copying. I like
music dearly, and I used to listen to the lady playing at the
<a name="tn_png_132a"></a><!--TN: "harpischord" changed to "harpsichord" on Page 130-->harpsichord."</p>

<p>"You eavesdropper!"</p>

<p>"I got the airs by heart to begin with; and next, as I saw
they were written in a book, I saw a method in it and I learnt
it."</p>

<p>"You dared to touch my book?" said Andrea, at the height
of indignation.</p>

<p>"I had no need to touch it; it lay open. I looked, and there
is no soiling a printed page by a look."</p>

<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>

<p>"Let me tell you," sneered the baron, "that we shall have
this imp declare that he can play the piano like Haydn."</p>

<p>"I might have learnt that if I had presumed to touch the
keys," said the youth, confidently.</p>

<p>Against her inclination, Andrea cast a second look on the
face animated by a feeling like a martyr's in fanaticism. But
the lord, who had not his daughter's calmness and clear
head, felt his wrath kindle at the youth being right and their
being inhumane in leaving him with the watchdog at
Taverney. It is hard to forgive an inferior for the wrong
which he may convict us with; hence he grew heated as his
daughter cooled.</p>

<p>"You rapscallion!" he said. "You desert and play the
vagabond and spout such tomfoolery as we hear when you
are brought to task. But as I do not wish the king's highway
to be infested with gipsy tramps and thieves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andrea held up her hand to appease the patrician, whose
exaggeration annulled his superiority. But he put her aside
and continued:</p>

<p>"I shall tell Chief of Police Sartines about you, and have
you locked up in the House of Correction, you fledgeling
philosopher."</p>

<p>"Lord Baron," returned Gilbert, drawing back but slapping
his hat down on his head with the ire which made him
white, "I have found patrons in town at whose door your
Sartines dances attendance!"</p>

<p>"The deuse you say so?" questioned the baron. "You shall
taste the stirrup leather anyway. Andrea, call your brother,
who is close to hand."</p>

<p>Andrea stooped out toward the offender and bade him begone
in an imperious voice.</p>

<p>"Philip," called the old noble.</p>

<p>Gilbert stood on the spot, mute and unmoving, as in ecstatic
worship. Up rode a cavalier at the call; it was the Knight
of Redcastle, joyous and brilliant in a captain's uniform.</p>

<p>"Why, it is Gilbert," he exclaimed. "The idea of his being
here! Good-day, Gilbert. What do you want, father?"</p>

<p>"I want you to whip this malapert with your sword-scabbard,"
roared the old patrician, pale with anger.</p>

<p>"What has he done?" inquired Philip, looking with growing
astonishment from his father in age to the youth who had
tranquilly returned his greeting.</p>

<p>"Never mind what he has done, but lash him, Philip, as you
would a dog!"</p>

<p>"What has he done?" asked the chevalier, turning to his
sister. "Has he insulted you?"</p>

<p>"I insult her?" repeated Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered Andrea. "He has done nothing.
Father let his passion get the upper hand of him. Gilbert is<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>
no longer in our service and has the right to go wherever he
likes. Father does not understand this and flew into a rage."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Captain Philip.</p>

<p>"All, brother, and I do not <a name="tn_png_134"></a><!--TN: "undestand" changed to "understand" on Page 132-->understand father's wrath about
such stuff and for the trash who do not deserve a look. Just
see if we are not to go on again, Philip."</p>

<p>Subdued by his daughter's serenity, the baron was quiet.
Crushed by such scorn, Gilbert lowered his head. Something
ran through his heart much like hatred. He would have preferred
Philip Taverney's sword or even a cut of his whip.
He came near swooning.</p>

<p>Luckily the speechmaking was over and the procession
moved forward once more. Andrea was carried on, and
faded as in a dream.</p>

<p>Gilbert thought he was alone in his grief, believing that he
could never support the weight of such misfortune. But a
hand was laid on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Turning, he saw Philip, who came smiling toward him,
having dismounted and given his steed to his orderly to hold.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear what has happened," he said, "and
how my poor Gilbert has come to Paris?"</p>

<p>This frank and cordial greeting touched the young man.</p>

<p>"What was I to do on the old place?" he asked, with a sigh,
torn from his wild stoicism. "I should have died of hunger,
ignorance and despair."</p>

<p>Philip started, for his impartial mind, like Andrea's,
was struck by the painful loneliness in which the youth was
left.</p>

<p>"But do you imagine that you can succeed in Paris, a poor
boy, without resources and protectors?"</p>

<p>"I do. The man who can work rarely dies of want, where
so many want to live without working."</p>

<p>The hearer started at this reply; previously he had regarded
him as a dependent of no importance.</p>

<p>"I earn my daily bread, Captain Philip, and that is a great
gain for one who was blamed for eating bread which he did
nothing for."</p>

<p>"I hope you are not referring to what you had at Taverney,
for your father and mother were good tenants and you
were often useful."</p>

<p>"I only did my duty."</p>

<p>"Mark me, Gilbert," continued the young gentleman.
"You know I always liked you. I looked upon you differently
to others. The future will show whether I was right or
wrong. To me your standing aloof was fastidiousness; your
plainspokenness I called straightforward."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the young man, breathing delightedly.</p>

<p>"It follows that I wish you well. Young like you and unhappy
as I was situated, I thus understood you. Fortune has<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>
smiled upon me. Let me help you in anticipation of the lady
on the wheel smiling on you likewise."</p>

<p>"I thank you."</p>

<p>"Do you blush to take my help, when all men are
brothers?"</p>

<p>Gilbert fastened his intelligent eyes on the speaker's noble
features, astonished at hearing the language from those lips.</p>

<p>"Such is the talk of the new generation," said he;
"opinions shared by the dauphin himself. Do not be proud
with me, but take what you may return me another day.
Who knows but that you may be a great financier or statesman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or doctor-surgeon," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Just as you please. Here is my purse; take half."</p>

<p>"I thank you, but I need nothing," replied the unconquerable
young man, softened by Philip's admirable brotherly love;
"but be sure that I am more grateful to you than if I had accepted
your offer."</p>

<p>He mingled with the mob, leaving Philip stupefied for several
seconds, unable to credit sight and hearing. Seeing Gilbert
did not reappear, he mounted his horse and regained his
place.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">THE MAGICIAN'S WIFE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">All</span> the rumbling of the coaches, the booming of the bells
swinging to the full extent, the rolling of the drums, all the
majesty of the society the Princess Louise had discarded in
order to live in the nunnery, glided over her soul and died
away at the base of her cell wall, like the useless tide. She
had refused to return to the court, and while her sisterhood
were still agitated by the royal visit, she alone did not
quiver when the heavy door banged and shut out the world
from her solitude.</p>

<p>She summoned her treasurer to her.</p>

<p>"During these two days of frivolous uproar," she inquired,
"have the poor been visited, the sick attended, and those
soldiers on guard given bread and wine!"</p>

<p>"Nobody has wanted in this house."</p>

<p>Suddenly the kick of a horse was heard against the woodwork
of the stables.</p>

<p>"What is that? Has any courtier remained?"</p>

<p>"Only his eminence the Cardinal de Rohan; that is the
horse of the Italian lady who came here yesterday to crave
hospitality of your highness."</p>

<p>"True; I remember. Where is she?"</p>

<p>"In her room, or in the church. She refuses all food save
bread, and prayed in the chapel all through the night."</p>

<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>

<p>"Some very guilty person, no doubt," said the lady superior,
frowning.</p>

<p>"I know not, for she speaks to no one."</p>

<p>"What is she like?"</p>

<p>"Handsome, but proud, along with tenderness."</p>

<p>"How did she act during the royal ceremony?"</p>

<p>"She peeped out of her window, hiding in the curtains,
and examined everybody as though she feared to see an
enemy."</p>

<p>"Some member of the class which I have reigned over.
What is her name?"</p>

<p>"Lorenza Feliciani."</p>

<p>"I know of no person of that name, but show her in."</p>

<p>Princess Louise sat in an ancient oak chair, carved in the
reign of Henri II. and used by nine Carmelite abbesses.
Before this seat of justice many poor novices had quailed
between spiritual and temporal power.</p>

<p>A moment following the treasurer returned, ushering in
the foreigner whom we know; she wore a long veil. With
the piercing eye of her race, Princess Louise studied Lorenza
on her entering the closet; but her hostile feelings became
sisterly and benevolent on seeing so much grace and humility
in the visitor, so much sublime beauty, and, in short, so much
innocence in the large black eyes wet with tears.</p>

<p>The princess prevented her dropping on her knees.</p>

<p>"Draw near and speak," said she. "Are you called Lorenza
Feliciani?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lady."</p>

<p>"You want to confide a secret to me?"</p>

<p>"I am dying with the desire."</p>

<p>"But why do you not go to the penitential chamber? I
have no power but to console; a priest can comfort and forgive."
She spoke the last word hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I need comfort alone; and to a woman alone can I entrust
my confession. Will you listen patiently to my most strange
story, to be told to you alone, for you are mighty, and I require
the hand of heaven to defend me."</p>

<p>"Defend? Are you pursued and attacked?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, my lady," said the fugitive, with unutterable
<a name="tn_png_136"></a><!--TN: "freight" changed to "fright" on Page 134-->fright.</p>

<p>"Reflect, madame, that this is a nunnery and not a <a name="tn_png_136a"></a><!--TN: Period changed to a comma after "castle" on Page 134-->castle,"
said the princess; "what agitates mankind enters here but to
be extinguished; weapons to use against man are not here; it
is the abode of God, not of might, repression and justice."</p>

<p>"The very thing I seek," answered Lorenza; "in the abode
of God alone can I find a life of rest."</p>

<p>"But not of vengeance. If you want reprisal on your foes,
apply to the magistrates."</p>

<p>"They can do nothing against the man whom I dread."</p>

<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>

<p>"Who can he be?" asked the lady superior, with secret and
involuntary fright.</p>

<p>"Who?" said the Italian, approaching the princess-abbess
under the sway of mysterious exaltation. "I am certain that
he is one of those devils who war against mankind, endowed
by their Prince Satan with superhuman power."</p>

<p>"What are you telling me?" said the other, regarding the
woman to make sure that she was not mad.</p>

<p>"What a wretch am I to have fallen across the path of this
demon," groaned Lorenza, writhing her lovely arms, seemingly
reft from a flawless ancient statue. "I am possessed
of a fiend," she gasped, going up to the lady and speaking in
a low voice, as if afraid to hear her own tones.</p>

<p>"Possessed! Speak out, if you are in your senses."</p>

<p>"I am not mad, though I may become so, if you drive me
away."</p>

<p>"But allow me to say that I see you like a creature favored
by heaven; you seem rich and are beauteous; you express
yourself correctly, and your face does not wear traces of the
terrible and mysterious complaint called demoniac possession."</p>

<p>"In my life, madame, and its adventures resides the sinister
secret which I wish I could keep from myself. Lady, I
am a Roman, where my father came of the old patricians,
but like most Roman nobles, he is poor. I have also a mother
and elder brother. In France, when an aristocratic family has
a son and a daughter, she is put into a nunnery that the
money which should have been her marriage portion shall
buy the son a military commission. Among us, the daughter
is sacrificed to help the son rise in holy orders. I was given
no education, while my brother was trained to be a cardinal,
as my mother simply said. I was destined to take the veil
among the Subiaco Carmelites. Such a future had been held
out to me from youth as a necessity. I had no will or
strength in the matter. I was not consulted but ordered, and
had to obey. We Roman girls love society without knowing
anything about it, as the suffering souls in paradise love
heaven. I was surrounded by examples which would have
doomed me, had the idea of resistance come to me, but none
such came. But my mother fondled me a little more than
usual when the fatal day dawned.</p>

<p>"My father gathered five hundred Roman crowns to pay
my entrance fee into the convent, and we set out for Subiaco.
It is some nine leagues from Rome; but the mountain
roads were so bad that we were five hours getting over three
of them. But the journey pleased me, though it might be
fatiguing. I smiled on it as my last pleasure, and along the
road bade farewell to the trees, bushes, stones and the dried
grass itself. I feared that in the nunnery would be not even
grass and flowers.</p>

<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>

<p>"Suddenly, amid my dreams, and as we were passing between
a grove and a pile of rocks, the carriage stopped. I
heard my mother scream, and my father jumped to get his
pistols. My eyes and mind dropped from the skies to the
earth, for we were stopped by highwaymen."</p>

<p>"Poor girl!" exclaimed Princess Louise, interested in the
tale.</p>

<p>"I was not frightened, for the brigands waylaid us for
money, and what they took was to pay my way into the nunnery;
hence there would be a delay until it was made up
again, and I knew that it would take time and trouble. But
when, after sharing this plunder, the bandits, instead of letting
us go our way, sprang upon me, and I saw my father's efforts
to defend me and my mother's tears in entreaty, then I comprehended
that a great though unknown misfortune threatened
me, and I began to call for mercy. It was natural,
though I knew that it was useless calling and that nobody
would hear in this wild spot. Hence, without heeding my
father's struggles, my mother's weeping, or my appeals, the
banditti tied my hands behind my back, and began throwing
dice on one of their handkerchiefs spread on the ground,
while burning me with hideous glances, which I understood
from terror giving me clearness of sight.</p>

<p>"What most frightened me was not to see any stake on the
board. I shuddered as the dice cup passed from hand to hand,
at the thought that I was the stake.</p>

<p>"All of a sudden, one of them, with a yell of triumph,
jumped up, while the others ground their teeth and swore.
He ran up to me, took me in his arms and pressed his lips to
mine. The contact of redhot iron could not have drawn a
more heartrending scream from me.</p>

<p>"'Rather death, O God!' I shrieked.</p>

<p>"My mother writhed on the ground where my father lay,
in a dead swoon. My only hope was that one of the losing
villains would kill me out of spite with the dagger he held in
his clenched fist. I waited for this stroke&mdash;longed, prayed
for it.</p>

<p>"Suddenly a horseman rode up the path. He spoke to one
of the sentinels, who let him pass, exchanging a sign with
him. He was of medium stature, imposing in mien and resolute
in gaze. He came on at the walking pace of his horse,
calm and tranquil. He stopped in front of me. The bandit
who had clutched me turned round sharply at the first blow
of the whistle which the stranger carried in the handle of his
riding whip. He let me drop to the ground.</p>

<p>"'Come here,' said the horseman, and as the bandit hesitated,
he formed a triangle with his arms, crossing his forefingers
upon his breast.</p>

<p>"As though this were the token of a mighty master, the<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>
robber went up to the stranger, who stooped down to his ear,
and said:</p>

<p>"'Mak.'</p>

<p>"I am sure he uttered but this single word, for I looked at
him as one looks at the knife about to slay oneself, and listened
as one does for the sentence of life or death.</p>

<p>"'Benak,' answered the highwayman.</p>

<p>"Subdued like a lion, with growling, he returned to me, untied
the rope round my wrists, and did the same release for my
parents. As the coin had been shared, every man went and
put his portion on a flat rock. Not a piece was missing.
Meanwhile I felt myself coming to life again in the hands of
my father and mother.</p>

<p>"'Be off,' said the deliverer to the robbers, who obeyed and
dived into the wood to the last man.</p>

<p>"'Lorenza Feliciani,' said the stranger, covering me with
a superhuman gaze, 'you are free to go your way.'</p>

<p>"My father and mother thanked the stranger who knew
me and yet was unknown to us. They stepped into the carriage
where I followed them with regret, for some unknown
power irresistibly attracted me toward my savior. He remained
unstirring in the same spot, as if to continue between
us and harm. I looked at him as long as I could and the
oppression on my bosom did not go off until he was lost to
view. In a couple of hours we reached Subiaco."</p>

<p>"But who was this extraordinary man?" cried Princess
Louise, moved by the simplicity of the story.</p>

<p>"Kindly let me finish. Alas! this is not the whole of it.</p>

<p>"On the road, we three did nothing but talk about the singular
liberator who had come mysteriously and powerfully like
an agent of heaven. Less credulous than me, my father suspected
him to be one of those heads of the robber leagues infesting
the suburbs of Rome, who have absolute authority to
reward, punish and share. Though I could not argue against
my father's experience, I obeyed instinct and the effect of my
gratitude, and did not believe him a robber. In my prayers
to the Madonna, I set aside a special one for her to bless my
savior.</p>

<p>"That same day I entered the convent. As the money
was ready, nothing prevented my reception. I was sad but
more resigned than ever. A superstitious Italian, I believed
that heaven had protected me from the devils to hand me over
pure to the religious haven. So I yielded with eagerness to the
wishes of my parents and the lady superior. A petition to be
made a nun without having to go through the novitiate in
the white veil was placed before me, and I signed it. My
father had written it in such fervent strains that the pope
must have thought the request was the ardent aspiration of a
soul disgusted with the world and turning to solitude. The<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>
plea was granted and I only had to be a novice for one month.
The news caused me neither joy nor displeasure. I seemed
already to be dead to the world, and a corpse with simply the
impassible spirit outliving it.</p>

<p>"They kept me immured a fortnight for fear the worldly
craving would seize me, and on the fifteenth morning ordered
me to go down into the chapel with the other sisters.</p>

<p>"In Italy, the convent chapels are public churches, the
pope not believing that priests should make a private house
of any place set aside for the worshippers of the Divine.</p>

<p>"I went into the choir and took my place. Between the
green screens supposed to veil the choir in was a space through
which the nave could be viewed. By this peep-crack out on
the world I saw a man standing by himself among the kneeling
crowd. The previous feeling of uneasiness came over
me once more&mdash;the superhuman attraction to my soul to draw
it forth, as I have seen my brother move iron filings on a
sheet of paper by waving a magnet underneath it.</p>

<p>"Alas! vanquished and subjugated, with no power to withstand
this attraction, I bent toward him, clasping my hands
as in worship, and with lips and heart I sent him my thanks.
My sisters stared at me with surprise, for they had not comprehended
my words nor my movement. To follow the direction
of my gesture and glance, they rose on tiptoe to peer over
into the nave, and I trembled; but the stranger had disappeared.
They questioned me, but I only blushed and faltered, as
next I turned pale.</p>

<p>"From that time, madame," said Lorenza, in despair, "I
have lived in the control of the devil!"</p>

<p>"I cannot say I see anything supernatural in this," observed
the princess, with a smile. "Pray be calm, and proceed."</p>

<p>"You do not know what I feel. The demon possesses me
entirely&mdash;body and soul. Love would not make me suffer so
much; would not shake me like a tree by the storm, and
would not give me the wicked thoughts coming to me. I
ought to confess these to the priest, and the demon bids me
not to think of such a thing.</p>

<p>"One day a pious friend, a neighbor and a Roman lady,
came to see me. She passed most of the time praying before
the image of the Virgin. That night in undressing I found
a note in the lining of my robe. It contained these lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'It is death here in Rome for a nun to love a man. But
will you not risk death for him who saved your life?'</p></blockquote>

<p>"That made his possession of me complete, lady; for I
should lie if I said that I thought about anybody more than
I do about that man."</p>

<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>

<p>Frightened at her own words, Lorenza stopped to study the
abbess' sweet and intelligent countenance.</p>

<p>"This is not demoniac possession," said Louise of France
with firmness. "It is but an unfortunate passion, and unless
in the state of regret, human passions have no business here."</p>

<p>"Regret? you see me in tears, on my knees, entreating you
to deliver me from the power of this infernal wretch, and you
talk of my regret? More than that, I feel remorse!</p>

<p>"My misery could not escape my companions' eyes. The
superior was notified, and she acquainted my mother. Only
three days after I had taken the vows, I saw the three persons
enter my cell who were my only kin&mdash;my mother, father and
brother. They came to embrace me for the last time, they
said, but I saw that they had another aim. Left alone with
me, my mother questioned me. The influence of the demon
was plain once more, for I was stubbornly silent.</p>

<p>"The day when I was to take the black veil came amid a
terrible struggle with myself, for I feared that then the fiend
would work his worst. Yet I trusted that heaven would save
me as it had when the robbers seized me, forgetting that heaven
had sent that man to rescue me.</p>

<p>"The hour of the ceremonial arrived. Pale, uneasy, but not
apparently more agitated than usual, I went down into the
church. I hurriedly assented to everything, for was I not in
the holy edifice and was I not my own mistress while that
demon was out of the way? All at once I felt that his step
was on the sill; irresistible attraction as before caused me to
turn my eyes away from the altar, whatever my efforts.</p>

<p>"All my strength fled me, even while the scissors were
thrust forward to cut my hair off&mdash;my soul seemed to leap
out of my throat to go and meet him, and I fell prostrate on
the stone slabs. Not like a woman swooning but like one in
a trance. I only heard a murmur, when the ceremony was
interrupted by a dreadful tumult."</p>

<p>The princess clasped her hands in compassion.</p>

<p>"Was not this a dreadful event," said the Roman, "in
which it was easy to recognize the intervention of the enemy
of mankind?"</p>

<p>"Poor woman!" said the abbess, with tender pity; "take
care! I am afraid that you are apt to attribute to the wonderful
what was but natural weakness. I suppose you saw this
man, and you fainted away. There was nothing more. Continue."</p>

<p>"Madame, when I came to my senses," said Lorenza, "it
was night. I expected to find myself in the chapel or in my
cell. But I saw rocks and trees around me; clouds; I was in
a grotto and beside me was a man, that persecutor! I touched
myself to make sure if I were alive and not dreaming. I
screamed, for I was clad in bridal white. On my brow was a<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>
wreath or white roses&mdash;such as the bride of man&mdash;or in
religion&mdash;wears."</p>

<p>The princess uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Next day," resumed the Italian, sobbing, and hiding her
head in her hands, "I reckoned the time which had elapsed,
I had been three days in the trance, ignorant of what transpired."</p>

<span class="chapterhead">THE NUN'S HUSBAND.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">A deep</span> silence long surrounded the two women, one in <a name="tn_png_142"></a><!--TN: "pain ful" changed to "painful" on Page 140-->painful
meditation, the other in astonishment readily understood.</p>

<p>"If you were removed out of the nunnery," said Lady
Louise, to break this silence, "you are unaware of how it was
done? Yet a convent is well enclosed and guarded, with bars
to the windows, walls of height and a warder who keeps the
keys. In Italy it is particularly so, where the regulations are
stricter than in France."</p>

<p>"What can I tell your ladyship, when I puzzle my brains
without finding a clue?"</p>

<p>"But if you saw this man, did you not blame him for the
abduction?"</p>

<p>"I did, but he excused himself on the plea that he loved me.
I told him that he frightened me, and that I was sure that I
did not like him. The strange feeling is another kind. I am
not myself when he is by, but his; whatever he wills, I must
do; one look fascinates me and subdues me. You see, lady,
this must be magic."</p>

<p>"At least, it is strange, if not supernatural," said the princess.
"But you are in the company of this man?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I do not love him."</p>

<p>"Then why not appeal to the authorities, your parents,
the ecclesiastical powers?"</p>

<p>"He so watched me that I could not move."</p>

<p>"But you could have written."</p>

<p>"On the road, he stopped at houses where everything is
owned by him and he is master of everybody. When I asked
the people about for writing materials, they gave no answer;
they were his bondwomen."</p>

<p>"But how did you travel?"</p>

<p>"At first in a postchaise; but at Milan, he had a kind of
house on wheels to continue the journey in."</p>

<p>"Still, he must have left you alone sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but then he bade me sleep, and sleep I did, only
waking up when he returned."</p>

<p>"You could not have strongly wanted to get away," observed
Princess Louise, shaking her head, "or else you would
have managed it."</p>

<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>

<p>"Alas! I was so fascinated."</p>

<p>"By his loving speech and endearments?"</p>

<p>"Seldom did he speak of love, and I remember me of no
caresses save a kiss night and morning."</p>

<p>"Really, this is very strange?" muttered the abbess; but as
a suspicion struck her, she resumed: "Repeat to me that
you do not love him, and that as no worldly tie unites you,
he would have no claim on you if he came."</p>

<p>"He has none."</p>

<p>"But tell me how you came here through all; for I am in a
fog," said the princess.</p>

<p>"I took advantage of a violent thunderstorm, which broke
on us near a town called Nancy, I believe. He left me to go
into a part of his travelling house which is inhabited by an old
man; I leaped upon his horse and fled. My resolution was to
hide in Paris, or some great city where I could be lost to all
eyes, especially to his. When I arrived here, all were talking
of your highness' retirement into the Carmelite convent.
All extolled your piety, solicitude for the unhappy,
and compassion for the afflicted. This was a ray of heavenly
light, showing me that you alone were generous enough to
receive me and powerful enough to defend me."</p>

<p>"You continually appeal to power, my child, as though
he were powerful?"</p>

<p>"I am ignorant what he is. I only know that no king inspires
more respect&mdash;no idol commands more adoration&mdash;than
he from those to whom he deigns to reveal himself."</p>

<p>"But his name&mdash;how is he entitled?"</p>

<p>"I have heard him called by many names. But only two
remain in my memory. One is used by the old man who is
his traveling companion from Milan to where I left him; the
other that he gives himself. The aged man calls him Acharat,
and that sounds anti-Christian, does it not, lady? He calls
himself Joseph Balsamo."</p>

<p>"What does he say of himself?"</p>

<p>"He knows everything and divines what he knew not. He
is the contemporary of all time. He has lived through all ages.
He speaks&mdash;the Lord forgive me! and forgive him for such
blasphemy! not only of Alexander the Great, Cæsar and
Charlemagne, as though he had known them, albeit I believe
they were dead ever so long ago, but also of the high priest
Caiaphas, Pontius Pilate and Our Lord Himself, whose martyrdom
he claims to have witnessed."</p>

<p>"He is some quack," said the Princess Louise.</p>

<p>"I do not clearly understand the word, madame; but he is
a dangerous man, terrible too, before whom everything bends,
snaps and crumbles away. When he is taken to be defenseless
he is armed at all points; when believed alone, he stamps<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>
his foot and an army springs up; or at a beck of the finger&mdash;smiling
the while."</p>

<p>"Very well," soothed the daughter of France; "take cheer,
my child; you will be protected against him. So long as
you desire the protection, of course. But do not believe any
longer in these supernatural visions born of a sick brain.
In any case the walls of St. Denis Abbey are a sure rampart
against infernal power, and what is more to be dreaded,
mark you! against human power. Now, what do you propose
doing?"</p>

<p>"With this property of mine, in jewels, I mean to pay for
my repose in a convent&mdash;if possible, in this one."</p>

<p>Lorenza placed on the table some twenty thousand crowns'
worth of bracelets, rings and earrings of price.</p>

<p>"These jewels are mine, as Balsamo gave them to me, and
I shall turn them over to Heaven's use. I have nothing of
his but his steed Djerid, which was the instrument of my deliverance,
but I should like him to have it. So I solicit the
favor of staying here, on my knees."</p>

<p>"Rest easy, my child," said the lady superior; "from this
time forth you may dwell among us; and when you shall
have shown by your exemplary conduct that you deserve the
favor, you may again be the bride of the Lord; and I will
answer for it that you will not be removed out of St. Denis
without knowledge of the superior."</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_144a"></a><!--TN: "Lorenze" changed to "Lorenza" on Page 140-->Lorenza fell at the princess feet and poured forth the most
affectionate and sincere thanks.</p>

<p>But suddenly she rose on one knee, and listened with
trembling and pallor.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, how I shake! he is coming! he means to be
my destroyer&mdash;that man is at hand. Do you not see how my
limbs quiver?"</p>

<p>"I see this, indeed."</p>

<p>"Now I feel the stab in the heart," continued the Italian:
"he comes nearer and nearer."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken."</p>

<p>"No, no. In spite of myself, he draws me to him. Hold
me <a name="tn_png_144b"></a><!--TN: "from back" changed to "back from" on Page 140-->back from him."</p>

<p>Princess Louise seized the speaker in her arms.</p>

<p>"Recover your senses, child," she said. "Even if any one
came, even he, you would be in safety here."</p>

<p>"He approaches&mdash;I tell you, he approaches," screamed
Lorenza, terrified into inertia, but with her hands and her
eyes directed toward the room door.</p>

<p>"Madness!" said the abbess. "Do you think that anybody
can intrude on the Royal Lady of France? None but the
bearer of an order from the king."</p>

<p>"I do not know how he entered," stammered the fugitive,<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>
recoiling, "but I am certain that he is coming up the stairs&mdash;he
is not ten steps off&mdash;there he is!"</p>

<p>The door flew open, so that the princess receded, frightened
in spite of herself by the odd coincidence. But it was a nun
who appeared.</p>

<p>"What do you want&mdash;who is there?" cried her superior.</p>

<p>"Madame, it is a nobleman who presents himself to have
speech with your royal highness."</p>

<p>"His title?"</p>

<p>"Count Fenix, please your highness."</p>

<p>"Do you know the name as his?" inquired the princess of
the fugitive.</p>

<p>"I do not know the name, but it is he," she replied.</p>

<p>"Charged with a mission to the king of France from the
king of Prussia," said the nun, "he wishes the honor of a
hearing by your highness."</p>

<p>Princess Louise reflected an instant; then turning to Lorenza
and bidding her go into her inner room, she ordered the
sister to show in the visitor. She went and took her chair,
waiting, not without emotion, for the sequel of the incident.</p>

<p>Almost instantly reappearing, the Carmelite ushered in a
man whom we have seen under the title of Fenix, at the presentation
of Jeanne Dubarry at court. He was garbed in the
same Prussian uniform, of severe cut; he wore the military
wig and the black stock; his expressive black eyes lowered in
presence of Princess Louise, but only with the respect of any
man for a princess of the royal house, whatever his rank.
He raised them rapidly, as though he feared showing too much
timidity.</p>

<p>"I thank your royal highness for the favor kindly done
me," he said, "though I reckoned upon it from knowing that
your highness always upholds the unfortunate."</p>

<p>"I endeavor so to do, my lord," replied the lady with
dignity, for she hoped in ten minutes to defeat the man who
impudently came to claim outside help to oppress where he
had abused his powers.</p>

<p>The count bowed as if he did not see any hidden meaning in
the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"What can I do for your lordship?" continued the lady in
the same tone of irony.</p>

<p>"Everything. I should like your highness to believe that
I would not without grave motives vex you in the solitude she
has chosen, but you have sheltered a person in whom I am
interested in all points."</p>

<p>"What is the name of this person?"</p>

<p>"Lorenza Feliciani."</p>

<p>"What is this person to you&mdash;a relative, sister?"</p>

<p>"She is my wife."</p>

<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>

<p>"Lorenza Feliciani, wife of Count Fenix!" said the abbess,
raising her voice so as to be heard in the inner room. "No
Countess Fenix is in St. Denis Abbey," she dryly added.</p>

<p>"It may be," said the count, who was not yet acknowledging
his defeat, "that your highness is not persuaded that Lorenza
and Countess Fenix are the same person. Kindly give the
order that Lorenza shall be brought before you, and all doubt
will cease. I ask pardon for being so persistent, but I am
tenderly attached to this wife of mine, and I believe she is
sorry we are separated, poor as is my merit."</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought the princess, "Lorenza spoke the truth, for
this man is highly dangerous."</p>

<p>The count stood with a calm bearing, strictly according to
court etiquette.</p>

<p>"I must prevaricate," thought Princess Louise, before she
said: "My lord, I am not in the position to restore a wife
who is not here. I understand your seeking her with such
persistency, if you love her as dearly as you say; but you
will have to seek elsewhere if you want success."</p>

<p>On entering, the count had glanced round the closet, and his
gaze had caught a reflection, however slight, of the jewels
placed by Lorenza on the little table in the darkest corner. By
the sparkling Fenix recognized them.</p>

<p>"If your royal highness would kindly collect your
memory, though I have to ask her to do such violence&mdash;it
will be recalled that Lorenza Feliciani was here, for she laid
those jewels on yonder table before she retired into the next
room."</p>

<p>The princess colored up as the count continued:</p>

<p>"So that I wait solely for your highness' leave for me to
order her to come forth, for I cannot doubt that she will immediately
obey."</p>

<p>The abbess remembered that Lorenza had locked the door
behind her, and consequently that she could not be prevailed
upon except by her own will to come out. No longer trying
to dissimulate her vexation at having been lying uselessly to
this man, from whom nothing could be concealed, she said:</p>

<p>"Were she to enter, what would be done to her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, your highness; she will merely tell you that she
wishes to go with her husband."</p>

<p>This encouraged the princess, recalling the Italian woman's
protests.</p>

<p>"It would seem that your highness does not believe me,"
said the count, in answer to her apparent indignation. "Is
there anything incredible in Count Fenix marrying Lorenza
Feliciani, and claiming his wife. I can easily lay before your
royal highness's eyes the marriage certificate, properly
signed by the priest who performed the ceremony."</p>

<p>The princess started, for such calmness shook her convic<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>tion. He opened a portfolio and took out a twice-folded
paper.</p>

<p>"This is the proof of my claim on my wife," he said; "the
signature ought to carry belief. It is that of the curate of St.
John's in Strasburg, well-known to Prince Louis of Rohan
for one, and were his eminence the cardinal here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is here at this very time," exclaimed the abbess, fastening
fiery looks on the count. "His eminence has not left
the abbey, where he is with the cathedral canons; so nothing
is more easy than the verification you challenge."</p>

<p>"This is a great boon to me," said the count, coolly replacing
the document in the pocket-book. "I hope this verification
will dispel your royal highness' unjust suspicions
against me."</p>

<p>"Indeed, impudence does disgust me," said the princess,
ringing her hand bell quickly.</p>

<p>The nun in waiting entered hastily.</p>

<p>"Send my courier to carry this note to Cardinal Rohan,
who is in the cathedral chapter. Let his eminence come
hither, as I await him."</p>

<p>While speaking she scribbled a couple of lines on paper
which she handed the nun, whispering:</p>

<p>"Post two archers of the rural guard in the corridor, and let
not a soul issue without my leave. Go!"</p>

<p>The count had watched all the princess' <a name="tn_png_147"></a><!--TN: "prepartions" changed to "preparations" on Page 145-->preparations to fight
out the battle with him. While she was writing, he
approached the inner room, and he muttered some words
while extending and working his hands in a movement more
methodical than nervous, with his eyes fastened on the
door. The princess, turning, caught him in the act.</p>

<p>"Madame," said the count, "I am adjuring Lorenza
Feliciani to come personally and confirm by her own words
and by her free will whether I am or not a forger and an
impostor, without prejudice to the other proofs your highness
may exact. Lorenza," called out the count, rising above all&mdash;even
to the princess' will, "come forth!"</p>

<p>The key grated in the lock and the princess beheld with
unspeakable apprehension the coming of the Italian beauty.
<a name="tn_png_147a"></a><!--TN: "Here" changed to "Her" on Page 145-->Her eyes were fixed on the count, with no show of hatred or
anger.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, child," faltered the Lady Louise, "and
why do you come to the man whom you shunned? I told you
that you were in safety there."</p>

<p>"She is also in safety in my house, my lady," replied the
nobleman. "Are you not in safety there, Lorenza," he
demanded of the refugee.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the other's answer.</p>

<p>At the height of amazement the princess clasped her hands
and dropped into her chair.</p>

<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>

<p>"Lorenza," went on the count, in a soft voice but one with
the accent of command, "I am accused of doing you violence.
Tell me if I have ever acted so toward you?"</p>

<p>"Never," replied the woman, in a clear and precise voice
but without any gesture accompanying the denial.</p>

<p>"Then what did the story about the abduction mean?"
questioned the princess.</p>

<p>Lorenza remained dumb, but looking at the count as though
all her life, and speech&mdash;which is its expression&mdash;must come
from him.</p>

<p>"Her highness doubtless wishes to know how you came to
leave your nunnery. Relate what happened from your fainting
in the choir until you awoke in our postchaise."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Lorenza in the same monotonous
voice.</p>

<p>"Speak, for I wish it."</p>

<p>"When I fainted, as the scissors touched my hair, I was
carried into my cell, and placed in bed. My mother stayed
with me until evening, when the village doctor declared that
I was dead."</p>

<p>"How did you know this?" inquired the princess.</p>

<p>"Her highness wishes to know how you were aware of
what went on," said the count.</p>

<p>"Strange thing!" said Lorenza, "I could see and hear but
without having my eyes open. I was in a trance."</p>

<p>"In fact," said the abbess, "I have heard Doctor Tronchin
speak of patients in catalepsy who were buried alive."</p>

<p>"Proceed Lorenza."</p>

<p>"My mother was in despair and would not believe in my
death. She passed six-and thirty hours beside me, without
my making a move or uttering a sigh. The priest came
three times and told my mother that she was wrong to dispute
the interment as her daughter had passed away just as
she was speaking the vow, and that my soul had gone straight
from the altar to heaven. But my mother insisted on watching
all Monday night.</p>

<p>"Tuesday morning I was in the same insensibility, and
my mother retired, vanquished. The nuns hooted her for the
sacrilege.</p>

<p>"The death-candles were lighted in the chapel, where the
custom was for the exposure of the body to repose a day and
a night.</p>

<p>"I was shrouded, dressed in white, as I had not taken the
vow; my hands crossed on my bosom, and a wreath of white
blossoms placed on my brow.</p>

<p>"When the coffin was brought in, I felt a shiver pass over
my body; for, I repeat, I saw all that happened as though I
were my second self standing invisibly beside my counter-part.</p>

<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>

<p>"I was placed in the coffin, and after my time of lying in
state, left with only the hospital sister to watch me.</p>

<p>"A dreadful thought tormented me in this lethargy&mdash;that I
should be buried living on the morrow unless some interposition
came.</p>

<p>"Each stroke of the time bell echoed in my heart, for I
was listening&mdash;doleful idea! to my own death-knell.</p>

<p>"Heaven alone knows what efforts I made to break the
iron bonds which held me down on the bier; but it had pity on
me in my frozen sleep, since here I am.</p>

<p>"Midnight rang.</p>

<p>"At the first stroke, I felt that convulsion experienced
whenever Acharat approached me; a shock came to my heart;
I saw him appear in the chapel doorway."</p>

<p>"Was it fright that you felt?" asked Count Fenix.</p>

<p>"No, no; it was joy, bliss, ecstasy, for I knew that he came
to tear me from the desperate death which I so abhorred.
Slowly he came up to my coffin; he smiled on me as he gazed
for a moment, and he said:</p>

<p>"<a name="tn_png_149"></a><!--TN: Single quote added before "Are" on Page 147-->'Are you glad to live? Then come with <a name="tn_png_149a"></a><!--TN: Double quote changed to a single quote after "me." on Page 147-->me.'</p>

<p>"All the bonds snapped at his call; I rose, extricated myself
from the bier as from the grave clothes, and passed by the
slumbering nun. I followed him who for the second time
had snatched me from death.</p>

<p>"Out in the courtyard I beheld the sky spangled with stars
which never more had I expected to see. I felt that cool
night air which blesses not the dead, but which is so refreshing
to the <a name="tn_png_149b"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "living." on Page 147-->living.</p>

<p>"'Now,' said my liberator, 'before quitting the convent,
choose between it and me. Will you be a nun, or will you
be my wife?' I wanted to be his wife, and I followed him.</p>

<p>"The tower gate was closed and locked. He asked where
were the keys, and as I said in the pocket of the wardress,
who slept within, he sent me there to get them.</p>

<p>"Five minutes after we were in the street. I took his arm
and we ran to the end of Subiaco village. A hundred paces
beyond the last house a postchaise was waiting, all ready.
We got in, and off it went at a gallop."</p>

<p>"And no violence was done you? No threat was proffered?
You followed the man willingly?"</p>

<p>Lorenza remained mute.</p>

<p>"Her royal highness asks you, Lorenza, if by threat or act
I forced you to follow me."</p>

<p>"No; I went because I loved you, darling."</p>

<p>With a triumphant smile, Count Fenix turned round to the
royal princess.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">COUNT AND CARDINAL.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">What</span> took place under the princess-abbess' sight was so
extraordinary that her mind, strong and yet tender, questioned
if she did not face a true magician who disposed of
sentiments and wills as he liked. But Count Fenix was not
going to leave things thus.</p>

<p>"As your royal highness has heard only part of the story
from my wife's lips, doubts might linger if the rest was not
spoken by them. Dear Lorenza," he said, turning again to
the Italian, "after leaving your country we went on a tour to
the Alps and to the Rhine, the magnificent Tiber of the
North&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lorenza has seen these sights," said the woman.</p>

<p>"Lured by this man&mdash;led by a power resistless of which
you spoke, my child?" suggested the princess.</p>

<p>"Why should your highness believe this when all you hear
is to the contrary? I have a palpable proof in the letter my
wife wrote me when I was obliged to leave her at Maintz. She
sorrowed and longed for me, so that she wrote this note,
which your highness may read."</p>

<p>She looked at the letter which the count took out of the letter
case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Return, Acharat; for all goes when you leave me. When
shall I have you for eternity? <span class="smcap alignright">Lorenza."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>With the flame of choler on her brow the princess went up
to the fugitive, holding out this letter. The other allowed
her to approach, without seeming to see or hear any but the
count. "I understand," said the latter, decided to clear up
matters completely. "Your highness doubts, and wishes to be
sure the writing is Lorenza's. She herself shall enlighten you.
Lorenza, answer; who wrote this note?"</p>

<p>On his putting the paper in her hand, she pressed it to her
heart.</p>

<p>"It was Lorenza," she said.</p>

<p>"Lorenza knows what is in it?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, then, tell the princess what it says, that she may
not believe that I deceive her in asserting that you love me.
I want you to tell her."</p>

<p>Appearing to make an effort, but without looking at the
note, unfolding it or bringing it to her eyes, she read, word
for word, what the princess had seen without speaking it
aloud.</p>

<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>

<p>"This is hard to believe," said the superior. "And I do
not believe you, from what is supernatural and inexplicable
in what happens."</p>

<p>"It was this very letter which determined me to hurry on
our wedding," said Count Fenix, without heeding the interruption.
"I love Lorenza as much as she loves me. In our
roaming life, accidents might happen. If I died, I wanted
my property to be my dear one's; so we were united when
we reached Strasburg."</p>

<p>"But she told me that she was not your wife."</p>

<p>"Lorenza," said the count, without replying to the abbess,
and turning to the Italian, "do you remember where and
when we were married?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in the St. John's Chapel of Strasburg Cathedral,
on the third of May."</p>

<p>"Did you oppose any resistance to the marriage?"</p>

<p>"No; I was only too happy."</p>

<p>"The fact is, Lorenza," continued the count, taking her
hand, "the princess thinks you were constrained to it."</p>

<p>"I hate you?" she said, shivering all over with delight.
"Oh, no; I love you. You are good, generous and mighty."</p>

<p>Seized with affright, the princess recoiled to where an ivory
crucifix gleamed on a black velvet background.</p>

<p>"Is this all your highness wishes to know?" asked Fenix,
letting Lorenza's hand fall.</p>

<p>"Keep away!" gasped the abbess; "and she, too!"</p>

<p>A carriage was heard to stop before the nunnery door.</p>

<p>"The cardinal?" exclaimed the lady superior; "we shall
see how things stand at last."</p>

<p>Fenix bowed, said a few words to the Italian woman, and
waited with the calmness of one who directs events.</p>

<p>In another instant the door opened and Cardinal Rohan
was announced.</p>

<p>"Show him in," said the abbess, encouraged by the new
addition to the party being a churchman.</p>

<p>The prince had no sooner saluted the princess than he exclaimed
with surprise on seeing Balsamo:</p>

<p>"Are you here, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Are you acquaintances?" cried the princess, more and
more astonished. "Then you can tell me who this is."</p>

<p>"Nothing is easier; the gentleman is a magician."</p>

<p>"His eminence will make this clear presently, and to everybody's
satisfaction," said the count.</p>

<p>"Has the gentleman been telling your highness' fortune,
that I see you so affected?" questioned the cardinal.</p>

<p>"The marriage certificate at once!" cried the princess, to
the astonishment of the newcomer, ignorant of the allusion.</p>

<p>"What is this?"</p>

<p>"My lord, the question is, whether this paper is real and the<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>
signature valid?" said the princess, as Balsamo held out the
document.</p>

<p>Rohan read the paper as presented by the abbess and nodded.</p>

<p>"It is in proper form, and the signature is Curate <a name="tn_png_152"></a><!--TN: "Saint-remy's" changed to "Saint-Remy's" on Page 150-->Saint-Remy's,

<p>"Considerable; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The signature might have been extorted."</p>

<p>"True, that is possible," said the princess.</p>

<p>"How about Lorenza's consent, then?" said the count,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"By what means could a priest have been induced&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the magic in the gentleman's powers."</p>

<p>"Your eminence is jesting."</p>

<p>"Not at all, and the proof is that I want to have a serious
explanation from this gentleman. Do not forget, my lord,
that I <a name="tn_png_152c"></a><!--TN: Duplicate "shall" removed after "I" on Page 150-->shall do all the questioning," added the cardinal,
with haughtiness.</p>

<p>"And remember that I was quite willing to answer aloud,
even before her royal highness&mdash;if your eminence desired so;
but I am certain you will not desire it."</p>

<p>The cardinal had to smile.</p>

<p>"My lord," said he, "it is hard to play the wizard nowadays.
I have seen you perform, and with great success; but
everybody has not the patience, and still less the generosity, of
the dauphiness."</p>

<p>"The dauphiness?" queried Princess Louise.</p>

<p>"Yes, your highness, I had the honor of presentation to
her," said the count.</p>

<p>"But how did you repay the honor? Answer that, my
lord."</p>

<p>"Alas, with more evil than I liked," said Fenix, "for I
have no personal hate to men, and less to women. My misfortune
was that I was compelled to tell your august niece the
truth she craved."</p>

<p>"A piece of truthfulness which caused her to faint."</p>

<p>"Is it fault of mine," retorted the mesmerist, in that voice
which he could sometimes make thunderous, "that truth is so
awful as to produce such effects? Did I seek out the princess,
and beg to be presented to her? No, I was avoiding her, when
they almost dragged me before her, and she ordered me to
answer her interrogation."</p>

<p>"But what was the dreadful truth you told her, my lord?"
inquired the princess.</p>

<p>"She saw it in the gap which I tore in the veil over the
future," rejoined the mysterious man. "That future which
has appeared so awful to your royal highness that you have
fled into a cloister to wrestle against it at the altar with tears
and prayers. Is it fault of mine, I say, if this future, revealed<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>
to you as a holy woman, should be shown to me as a precursor;
and if the dauphiness, alarmed at the fate personally
threatening her, swooned when it loomed upon her?"</p>

<p>"Do you hear this?" said the cardinal.</p>

<p>"Woe is <a name="tn_png_153"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "me!" on Page 151-->me!" moaned the Carmelite superior.</p>

<p>"For her reign is doomed as the most fatal and unfortunate
of the entire monarchy," continued the count.</p>

<p>"My lord!" cried the abbess.</p>

<p>"Perchance your prayers will earn your grace," proceeded
the prophet, "but then you will see nothing of what comes
to pass, as you will rest in the arms of the angels. Pray,
lady; continue to pray!"</p>

<p>Overcome by this prophetic voice, which harmonized so well
with the terrors in her soul, the princess dropped kneeling
before the crucifix and began indeed to pray, and with fervor.</p>

<p>"Now, our turn, cardinal," said the count turning to the
prince, and leading him into a window recess. "Speak as to
your want of me."</p>

<p>"I want to know what you are?"</p>

<p>"You do know&mdash;you say that I am a magician."</p>

<p>"I mean that you are called Joseph Balsamo in the south;
and here, Count Fenix."</p>

<p>"That merely proves that I change my name."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I would have you know that such changes on
the part of such a man will set Chief of Police Sartines to
thinking."</p>

<p>"This is petty warfare for a Rohan," said the other,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Your eminence stoops to wrangle over words. <i>Verba et
voces</i>, says the Latin. Is there nothing worse to fling at me?"</p>

<p>"You are railing, my lord."</p>

<p>"Always; it is my style."</p>

<p>"Then I shall make you change your note; which will
help me in the good graces of the dauphiness, whom you have
offended."</p>

<p>"Do so, as it will not be a useless act, considering the delicate
ground on which you stand as regards her," returned
Balsamo phlegmatically.</p>

<p>"What will you say if I have you arrested straightway,
my lord the horoscopist?"</p>

<p>"You would do yourself injury, my lord cardinal."</p>

<p>"Really! How do you make that out?" demanded the proud
peer with crushing scorn.</p>

<p>"You would unmake yourself."</p>

<p>"At least, we shall know who really is Baron Joseph Balsamo,
<i>alias</i> Count Fenix, a sprig of a family tree of which I
have never seen the picture in any heraldic work in Europe."</p>

<p>"You should have asked to see it in the portfolio of the Duke
of Breteuil, your friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>

<p>"His grace is no friend of mine."</p>

<p>"He was, and an intimate one, or your eminence would
never have written him that letter&mdash;but draw closer, my lord,
lest we are overheard in what may compromise you!&mdash;that letter
written from Vienna to Paris to dissuade the dauphin from
making his marriage."</p>

<p>"That letter!" gasped the prince, starting with fright.</p>

<p>"I know it by heart."</p>

<p>"Breteuil has betrayed? because he said it was&mdash;burned
when I asked it back, when the marriage was settled."</p>

<p>"He did not like to admit that he had lost it. A lost letter
may be found; and, indeed, I found it in the Marble Court at
Versailles. I took good care not to restore it to the duke, for
I knew your eminence was ill-disposed toward me. If you were
going through the woods and expected highwaymen to attack
you, and you found a loaded pistol, would you not pick it up
to use it? A man would be an idiot not to do so."</p>

<p>The cardinal felt giddy and leaned on the window-sill.
After hesitation, during which the count watched the play of
his features, he said:</p>

<p>"Granted thus. But it shall never be said that a prince of
my line yielded to the threats of a mountebank. Though
this letter may have been lost, and found, and will be shown
to the dauphiness herself, and may ruin me as a politician, I
will stand to it that I am still a loyal subject and a faithful
ambassador. I will speak the truth&mdash;that I thought the alliance
injurious to the interests of my country, and let it defend
me or blame me."</p>

<p>"But what will be the answer of this faithful subject and
loyal envoy if somebody asserts that this gallant young
beau of an ambassador, never doubting his winning all before
him with his title of prince and name of Rohan, did not say
this from any opinion that the alliance would be hurtful to
his country, but because&mdash;being graciously welcomed by
Marie Antoinette&mdash;this coxcomb of an envoy had the vanity
to think the feast was fitter for Jack than his master?"</p>

<p>"He would deny; for of this feeling which you pretend to
have existed, no proof can be exhibited."</p>

<p>"You are wrong; the token is in the dauphiness' coldness
toward you."</p>

<p>The cardinal wavered.</p>

<p>"Believe me, prince," went on the count, "instead of
quarreling, as we should have done, only for my having
more prudence than you, we had better be friends&mdash;good ones,
for such do one another service."</p>

<p>"Have I ever asked aught of your lordship?"</p>

<p>"Just there you are wrong; for you might have called on
me during the two days you spent in town. You cannot
conceal from a sorcerer what you have been about. You left<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>
the Austrian princess at Soissons, whence you rushed posthaste
to Paris, where you dunned your friends for help, which
they all refused you. This left you desperate."</p>

<p>"What kind of help could I expect from you, had I applied?"
asked the Rohan, confounded.</p>

<p>"Such as a man gives who can make gold. And you ought
to want gold when you have to pay five hundred thousand
francs in forty-eight hours. You want to know what good
a man is who makes gold? Why, he is the very one where you
will find the cash demanded. You could easily tell my house
in Saint Claude Street in the swamp, as the knocker is a brass
griffin."</p>

<p>"When could I call?"</p>

<p>"Six, to-morrow afternoon, please your eminence, and
whenever after you like. But we have finished our chat in
time, for the princess has concluded her devotions."</p>

<p>The cardinal was conquered.</p>

<p>"Your highness," he said, "I am forced to acknowledge
that Count Fenix is quite right; the document he produces is
most reliable, and the explanations he has furnished have completely
satisfied me."</p>

<p>"Your highness' orders?" asked the count, bowing.</p>

<p>"Let me put one last question to this young lady."</p>

<p>Again the count bowed in assent.</p>

<p>"Is it of your own free will that you quit the abbey of St.
Denis, where you came to seek refuge?"</p>

<p>"Her highness," repeated Fenix, quickly, "asks you
whether you are leaving this place of your own free will.
Speak out Lorenza."</p>

<p>"I go of my own free will," replied the Italian.</p>

<p>"In order to accompany Count Fenix, your husband?"
prompted the magician.</p>

<p>"To accompany my husband."</p>

<p>"In this case I retain neither of you," said the princess,
"for it would be running counter to my feelings. But, if there
be anything in all this out of the natural order of things, may
the divine punishment fall on whomsoever disturbs the <a name="tn_png_155"></a><!--TN: "harmany" changed to "harmony" on Page 153-->harmony
of nature for his profit or interests. Go, my Lord
Count Fenix; and you, Lorenza Feliciani&mdash;I detain you no
more. But take back your jewels."</p>

<p>"They are for the poor," replied Balsamo; "distributed by
your hands, the alms will be doubly agreeable to God. All
I ask is to have my horse Djerid."</p>

<p>"Take him as you go forth. Begone!"</p>

<p>Bowing to the speaker, the count presented his arm to Lorenza,
who leaned upon it and walked out without a word.</p>

<p>"Alas, my lord cardinal," sighed the abbess, sadly shaking
her head, "in the very air we breathe are fatal and incomprehensible
things!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">NEAR NEIGHBORS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">On</span> parting from young Taverney, Gilbert had plunged into
the crowd. But not with a heart bounding with glee and expectation&mdash;rather
with the soul ulcerated by grief which the
noble's kind welcome and obliging offers of assistance could
not mollify.</p>

<p>Andrea never suspected that she had been cruel to the
youth. The fair and serene maiden was completely unaware
that there could be any link between her and her foster-brother,
for joy or sorrow. She soared over earthly spheres,
casting on them shine or shadow according to her being
smiling or gloomy. This time it chanced that her shade of disdain
had chilled Gilbert; as she had merely followed the impulse
of her temper, she was ignorant that she had been scornful.</p>

<p>But Gilbert, like a disarmed gladiator, had received the
proud speech and the scorning looks straight in the heart. He
was not enough of a philosopher yet not to console himself
with despair while the wound was bleeding.</p>

<p>Hence he did not notice men or horses in the press. Gathering
up his strength, he rushed into it, at the risk of being
crushed, like a wild boar cutting through the pack of hounds.</p>

<p>At length breathing more freely, he reached the green
sward, water side and loneliness. He had run to the river
Seine, and came out opposite St. Denis island. Exhausted,
not by bodily fatigue but by spiritual anguish, he rolled on
the grass, and roared like a lion transfixed by a spear, as if the
animal's voice better expressed his woes than human tongue.</p>

<p>Was not all the vague and undecided hope which had flung
a little light on the mad ideas, not to be accounted for to himself,
now extinguished at a blow? To whatever step on the
social ladder Gilbert might rise by dint of genius, science and
study, he would always be a man or a thing&mdash;according
to her own words, for which her father was wrong in paying
any attention, and not worth her lowering her eyes upon.</p>

<p>He had briefly fancied that, on seeing him in the capital,
and learning his resolution to struggle till he came up through
the darkness, Andrea would applaud the effort. Not only had
the cheer failed the brave boy, but he had met the haughty
indifference always had for the dependent by the young lady
of the manor.</p>

<p>Furthermore she had shown anger that he should have
looked at her music book; had he touched it, he did not doubt
that he would be thought fit to be burned at the stake.</p>

<p>As he writhed on the turf, he knew not whether he loved<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>
or hated his torturer; he suffered, that was all. But as he was
not capable of long patience, he sprang out of his prostration,
decided to invent some energetic course.</p>

<p>"Granted that she does not love me," he reasoned, "I must
not hope that she never will. I had the right to expect from
her the mild interest attached to those who wrestle with their
misfortune. She did not understand what her brother saw.
He thought that I might become a celebrity; should it happen
so, he would act fairly and let me have his sister, in reward of
my earned glory, as he would have exchanged her for my
native aristocracy, had I been born his equal.</p>

<p>"But I shall always be plain Gilbert in her eyes, for she looks
down in me upon what nothing can efface, gild or cover&mdash;my
low birth. As though, supposing I attain my mark, it would
not be greater of me than if I had started on her high level!
Oh, mad creature! senseless being! oh, woman, woman&mdash;your
other name is Imperfection.</p>

<p>"Do not be deluded by the splendid gaze, intelligent smile,
and queenly port of Andrea de Taverney, whose beauty makes
her fit to rule society&mdash;she is but a rustic dame, straitlaced,
limited, swathed in aristocratic prejudices. Equals for her
are those empty-headed fops, with effete minds, who had the
means to learn everything and know nothing; they are the
men to whom she pays heed. Gilbert is but a dog, less than a
dog, for I believe she asked after Mahon, and not about my
welfare.</p>

<p>"Ah, she is ignorant that I am fit to cope with them; when
I wear the like coats, I shall look as well; and that, with my
inflexible determination, I shall grasp&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A dreadful smile was defined on his lips where the sentence
died away unfinished. Frowning, he slowly lowered his head.</p>

<p>What passed in that obscure soul? What terrible plan bent
the pale forehead, already sallow with sleepless nights, and
furrowed by thinking? Who shall tell?</p>

<p>At the close of half an hour's profound meditation, Gilbert
rose, coldly determined. He went to the river, drank a long
draft, and looking round, saw the distant waves of the people
in a sea coming out of St. Denis.</p>

<p>They so crowded in upon the first coaches that the horses
had to go at a walk, on the road to St. Ouen.</p>

<p>The dauphin wanted the ceremony to be a national family
festival. So the French family abused the privilege; a number
of Parisians climbed on the footboards and hung there without
being disturbed.</p>

<p>Very soon Gilbert recognized the Taverney carriage, with
Philip holding in his capering horse by the side.</p>

<p>"I must know where she goes," thought the lover; "and so
shall follow them."</p>

<p>It was intended that the dauphiness should sup with the<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>
royal family in private at Muette, but Louis XV. had broken
the etiquette so far as to make up a larger party. He handed
a list of guests to the dauphiness, with a pencil, and suggested
she should strike out the names of any not liked to come.
When she came to the last name, Countess Dubarry's, she felt
her lips quiver and lose blood; but sustained by her mother's
instructions, she summoned up her powers to her aid, and with
a charming smile returned the paper and pencil to the king,
saying that she was very happy to be let into the bosom of all
his family at the very first.</p>

<p>Gilbert knew nothing about this, and it was only when he
got to Muette that he recognized the coach of Dubarry,
with Zamore mounted on a high white horse. Luckily it was
dark, and Gilbert threw himself on the ground in a grove
and waited.</p>

<p>The king, then, shared supper between mistress and
daughter-in-law, and was merry especially on seeing that the
newcomer treated the usurper more kindly even than at Compiegne.</p>

<p>But the dauphin, gloomy and careworn, spoke of having
the headache, and retired before they sat at table.</p>

<p>The supper was prolonged to eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>The king sent a band of music to play to the repast for the
gentry of the retinue&mdash;of which our proud Andrea had to admit
she was a member; as the accommodation was limited,
fifty masters had to picnic on the lawn, served by men
in royal livery. In the thicket, Gilbert lost nothing of this
scene. Taking out a piece of bread, he ate along with the
guests, while watching that those he attended to did not slip
away.</p>

<p>After the meal, the dauphiness came out on the balcony
to take leave of her hosts. Near her stood the king. Countess
Dubarry kept out of sight in the back of the room, with that
exquisite tact which even her enemies allowed she had.</p>

<p>The courtiers passed under the balcony to salute the king,
who named such of them to the dauphiness as she did not already
know. From time to time some happy allusion or
pleasant saying dropped from his lips, to delight those who
received it. Seeing this servility, Gilbert muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"I am a touch above these slaves, for I would not crouch
like that for all the gold in the world."</p>

<p>He rose on one knee when the turn came for the Taverneys
to pass.</p>

<p>"Captain Taverney," said the dauphiness, "I grant you
leave to conduct your father and sister to Paris."</p>

<p>In the nightly silence and amid the attention of those
drinking in the august words, Gilbert caught the sound coming
in his direction.</p>

<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>

<p>"My lord baron," continued the princess, "I have no accommodation
yet for you among my household; so guard
your daughter in town until I set up my establishment at Versailles.
Keep me in mind, my dear young lady."</p>

<p>The baron passed on with son and daughter. Others came
up for whom the princess had pretty stuff to say, but that little
mattered to Gilbert. Gliding out of the covert, he followed
the baron among the two hundred footmen shouting
out their master's names, fifty coachmen roaring out in answer
to the lackeys, while sixty coaches rolled over the pavement
like thunder.</p>

<p>As Taverney had a royal carriage, it waited for him aside
from the common herd. He stepped in, with Andrea and
Philip, and the door closed after them.</p>

<p>"Get on the box with the driver," said Philip to the footman.
"He has been on his feet all day, and must be worn
out."</p>

<p>The baron grumbled some remonstrance not heard by Gilbert,
but the lackey mounted beside the driver. Gilbert went
nearer. At the time of starting a trace got loose and the
driver had to alight to set it right.</p>

<p>"It is very late," said the baron.</p>

<p>"I am dreadfully tired," sighed Andrea. "I hope we shall
find a sleeping place somewhere."</p>

<p>"I expect so," replied her brother. "I sent Labrie and
Nicole straight to Paris from Soissons. I gave him a letter
to a friend for him to let us have a little house in the rear of
his, where his mother and sister live when they come up from
the country. It is not luxury, but it is comfortable. You do
not want to make a show while you are waiting for the
coming out in the suitable style."</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_159"></a><!--TN: "Anthing" changed to "Anything" on Page 157-->"Anything will easily beat Taverney," said the old lord.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, yes," added the captain.</p>

<p>"Any garden?" asked Andrea.</p>

<p>"Quite a little park, for town, with fine trees. However,
you will not long enjoy it, as you will be presented as soon
as the wedding is over."</p>

<p>"We are in a bright dream&mdash;do not waken us. Did you
give the coachman the address?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," replied the young noble, while Gilbert greedily
listened.</p>

<p>He had hoped to catch the address.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he muttered; "it is only a league to town.
I will follow them."</p>

<p>But the royal horses could go at a rattling gait when not
kept in line with others. The trace being mended, the man
mounted his box and drove off rapidly&mdash;so rapidly that this
reminded poor Gilbert of how he had fallen on the road under
the hoofs of Chon's post-horses.</p>

<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>

<p>Making a spurt, he reached the untenanted footboard, and
hung on behind for an instant. But the thought struck him
that he was in the menial's place behind Andrea's carriage,
and he muttered:</p>

<p>"No! it shall not be said that I did not fight it out to the
last. My legs are tired, but not my arms."</p>

<p>Seizing the edge of the footboard with both hands, the inflexible
youth swung his feet up under the body of the coach
so as to get them on the foresprings; thus suspended, he was
carried on, spite of the jerking, over the wretched rutty road.
He stuck to the desperate situation by strength of arm, rather
than capitulate with his conscience.</p>

<p>"I shall learn her address," he thought. "It will be another
wakeful night; but to-morrow I shall have repose,
seated while I am copying music. I have a trifle of money,
too, and I will take a little rest."</p>

<p>He reflected that Paris was very large and that he might be
lost after seeing the baron to his house. Happily it was near
midnight, and dawn came at half after three.</p>

<p>As he was pondering he remarked that they crossed an open
place where stood an equestrian statue in the midst.</p>

<p>"Victories Place," he thought gleefully; "I know it."</p>

<p>The vehicle turning partly round and Andrea put her head
out to see the statue.</p>

<p>"The late king," explained her brother. "We are pretty
nearly there now."</p>

<p>They went down so steep a hill that Gilbert was nearly
scraped off.</p>

<p>"Here we are," cried the dragoon captain.</p>

<p>Gilbert dropped and slipped out from beneath to hide behind
a horseblock on the other side.</p>

<p>Young Taverney got out first, rang at a house doorbell,
and returned to receive Andrea in his arms. The baron was
the last out.</p>

<p>"Are those rascals going to keep us out all night?" he
snarled.</p>

<p>At this the voices of Labrie and Nicole were heard, and a
door opened. The three Taverneys were engulfed in a dark
courtyard where the door closed upon them. The vehicle
and attendants went their way to the royal stables.</p>

<p>Nothing remarkable was apparent on the house; but the
carriage lamps had flashed on the next doorway, which had a
label: "This is the mansion of the Armenonvilles." Gilbert did
not know what street it was as yet, but going to the far end,
the same the carriage had gone out of, he was startled to see
the public fountain at which he drank in the mornings.
Going ten paces up the street he saw the baker's shop where
he supplied himself. Still doubting, he returned to the
corner. By the gleam of a swinging lamp, he could read on a<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>
white stone the name read three days before when coming
from Meudon Wood with Rousseau:</p>

<p>"Plastrière Street."</p>

<p>It followed that Andrea was lodged a hundred steps apart,
nearer than she was to him at Taverney.</p>

<p>So he went to his own door, hoping that the latchet might
not be drawn altogether within. It was pulled in, but it was
frayed and a few threads stuck out. He drew one and then
another so that the thong itself came forth at last. He lifted
the latch, and entered, for it was one of his lucky days.</p>

<p>He groped up the stairs one by one, without making any
noise, and finally touched the padlock on his own bedroom
door, in which Rousseau had thoughtfully left the key.</p>



<hr style="width:65%;">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE GARDEN HOUSE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">From</span> coming home so late, and dropping off to sleep so soon
and heavily, Gilbert forgot to hang up the linen cloth which
served as curtain to the garret window. The unintercepted
sunbeam struck his eyes at five and speedily woke him. He
rose, vexed at having overslept.</p>

<p>Brought up in the country, he could exactly tell the time by
the sun's inclination and the amount of heat it emitted. He
hastened to consult this clock. The pallor of the dawn,
scarcely clearing the high trees, set him at ease; he was rising
too early, not too late.</p>

<p>He made his ablutions at the skylight, thinking over what
had happened over night, and gladly baring his burning and
burdened forehead to the fresh morning breeze. Then it came
to his mind that Andrea was housed next door to Armenonville
House, in an adjoining street. He wanted to distinguish this
residence.</p>

<p>The sight of shade-trees reminded him of her question to
her brother,&mdash;Was there a garden where they were going?</p>

<p>"Why may it not be just such a house in the back garden
as we have yonder?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence with his thought, a sound and a
movement quite unusual drew his attention where it was
turning; one of the long fastened up windows of a house
built at the rear of the one on the other street shook under a
rough or clumsy hand. The frame gave way at the top; but
it stuck probably with damp swelling it at the bottom. A still
rougher push started the two folds of the sash, which opened
like a door, and the gap showed a girl, red with the exertion
she had to make and shaking her dusty hands.</p>

<p>Gilbert uttered an outcry in astonishment and quickly drew
back, for this sleepy and yawning girl was Nicole.</p>

<p>He could harbor no doubt now. Philip Taverney had told<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>
his father that he had sent on Labrie and their maid servant
to get a lodging ready in Paris. Hence this was the one. The
house in Coq-Heron Street, where the travelers had disappeared&mdash;was
this with the extra building in the rear.</p>

<p>Gilbert's withdrawal had been so marked that Nicole must
have noticed it only for her being absorbed in that idle fit
seizing one just arisen. But he had retired swiftly, not
to be caught by her while looking out of a garret window.
Perhaps if he had lived on the first floor, and his window had
given a view within of a richly furnished apartment, he
would have called her attention on it. But the fifth flat still
classed him among social inferiors, so that he wanted to keep
in the background.</p>

<p>Besides, it is always an advantage to see without being seen.</p>

<p>Again, if Andrea saw him, might she not consider that
enough to induce her to move away, or at least not to stroll
about the garden?</p>

<p>Alas, for Gilbert's conceit! it enlarged him in his own eyes;
but what mattered Gilbert to the patrician, and what would
make her move a step nearer or further from him? Was she
not of the class of women who would come out from a bath
with a peasant or a footman by, and not regard them as men?</p>

<p>But Nicole was not of this degree, and she had to be avoided.</p>

<p>But Gilbert did not keep away from the window. He returned
to peep out at the corner.</p>

<p>A second window, exactly beneath the other, opened also,
and the white figure appearing there was Andrea's. In a
morning gown, she was stooping to look after her slipper
fallen under a chair.</p>

<p>In vain did Gilbert, every time he saw his beloved, make a
vow to resist his passion within a rampart of hate; the same
effect followed the cause. He was obliged to lean on the wall,
with his heart throbbing as if to burst and the blood boiling
all over his body.</p>

<p>As the arteries cooled gradually, he reflected. The main
point was to spy without being seen. He took one of Madame
Rousseau's old dresses off the clothesline, and fastened it with
a pin on a string across his window so that he might watch
Andrea under the improvised screen.</p>

<p>Andrea imitated Nicole in stretching her lovely arms, which,
by this extension, parted the gown an instant; then she
leaned out to examine the neighboring grounds at her leisure.
Her face expressed rare satisfaction, for while she seldom
smiled on men, she made up for it by often smiling on things.</p>

<p>On all sides the rear house was shaded by fine trees.</p>

<p>Rousseau's house attracted her gaze like all the other buildings,
but no more. From her point, the upper part alone
could be espied, but what concern had she in the servants'
quarters in a house?</p>

<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>

<p>Andrea therefore came to the conclusion that she was unseen
and alone, with no curious or joking face of Parisians on
the edge of this tranquil retreat, so dreaded by country
ladies.</p>

<p>Leaving her window wide open for the sunshine to flush the
remotest corners, the young lady went to pull the bellrope at
the fire-place side and began to dress in the twilight. Nicole
ran in and opening the straps of a shagreen dressing-case
dating from a previous reign, took a tortoise-shell comb and
disentangled her mistress' tresses.</p>

<p>Gilbert smothered a sigh. He could hardly be said to
recognize the hair, for Andrea followed the fashion in powdering
it, but he knew her a hundred times fairer without the
frippery than in the most pompous decorations. His mouth
dried up, his fingers scorched with fever, and his eye ceased to
see from his staring <a name="tn_png_163"></a><!--TN: "to" changed to "too" on Page 161-->too hard.</p>

<p>Chance ruled that Andrea's gaze, idle as it was from her sitting
still to have her hair brushed, fell on Rousseau's attic.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, keep on staring," uttered the youth, "but you
will see nothing and I shall see all."</p>

<p>But he was wrong, for she descried the novel screen of the
old dress which floated round the man's head as a kind of
turban. She pointed out this odd curtain to her maid.
Nicole stopped and pointed with the comb to the object to ask
whether that were the reason for her mistress' amusement.</p>

<p>Without his suspecting it, this had a fourth spectator.</p>

<p>He suddenly felt a hasty hand snatch Madame Rousseau's
dress from his brow, and he fell back thunderstricken at recognizing
the master.</p>

<p>"What the deuse are you up to?" queried the philosopher,
with a frowning brow and a sour grin as he examined the
gown.</p>

<p>"Nothing," stammered the other, trying to divert the intruder's
sight from the window.</p>

<p>"Then why hide up in this dress?"</p>

<p>"The sun was too bright for me."</p>

<p>"The sun is at the back of us, and I think it is you who are
too bright for me. You have very weak eyes, young man."</p>

<p>Rousseau walked straight up to the window. By a very
natural feeling to be a veil to his beauty, Gilbert, who had
shrunk away, now rushed in between.</p>

<p>"Bless me, the rear house is lived in now!" The tone froze
the blood in Gilbert's veins, and he could not get out a word.
"And by people who know my house, for they are pointing up
to it," added the suspicious author.</p>

<p>Gilbert, fearful now that he was too forward, retreated.
Neither the movement nor its cause escaped Rousseau, who
saw that his <a name="tn_png_163a"></a><!--TN: "employe" changed to "employee" on Page 161-->employee trembled to be seen.</p>

<p>"No, you don't, young man!" he said, grasping him by the<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>
wrist; "there is some plot afoot, for they are pointing out
your garret. Stand here, pray."</p>

<p>He placed him before the window, in the uncovered glare.</p>

<p>Gilbert would have had to struggle with his idol, and respect
restrained him from thus being free.</p>

<p>"You know those women, and they know you," continued
Rosseau, "or, why do you shrink from showing yourself?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Rousseau, you have had secrets in your life.
Pity for mine!"</p>

<p>"Traitor!" cried the writer; "I know your sort of secret.
You are the tool of my enemies, the Grimms and Holbachs.
They taught you a part to captivate my benevolence, and,
sneaking into my house, you are betraying me. Threefold
fool that I am, stupid lover of nature, to think I was helping
one of my kind, and to nourish a spy!"</p>

<p>"A spy?" repeated the other in revolt.</p>

<p>"When are you to deliver me to my murderers, O Judas?"
demanded Rousseau, draping himself in Therese's dress, which
he had mechanically kept in hand, and looking droll when he
fancied he was sublime with sorrow.</p>

<p>"You calumniate me, sir," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Calumniate this little viper!" said the philosopher, "when
I catch you corresponding in dumb show with my enemies&mdash;I
daresay acquainting them in signs with my latest work."</p>

<p>"Had I come to steal your story, sir, I should better have
made a copy of the manuscript, lying on your desk, than to
convey it in signs."</p>

<p>This was true, and Rousseau felt that he had made one of
those blunders which escaped him in his moments of fear, and
he became angry.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for you, but experience makes me stern," he
said. "My life has passed amid deceit. I have been betrayed
by everybody, denied, sold and martyrized. You
know I am one of those illustrious unfortunates whom governments
outlaw. Under such circumstances, I may be allowed
to be suspicious. As you are a suspicious character, you
must take yourself out of this house."</p>

<p>Gilbert had not expected this conclusion. He was to be
driven forth! He clenched his fists, and a flash in his eyes
made Rousseau start. Gilbert reflected that in going he
would lose the mild pleasure of seeing his loved one during
the day, and lose Rousseau's affection&mdash;it was shame as well
as misfortune.</p>

<p>Dropping from his fierce pride, he clasped his hands and
implored:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, if only one word!"</p>

<p>"I am merciless," replied the author: "man's injustice
has made me more ferocious than a tiger. Go and join my
enemies with whom you correspond. League yourself with<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>
them, which I do not hinder, but do all this beyond my
domicile."</p>

<p>"Those young women are no enemies of yours&mdash;they are
Mademoiselle Andrea of Taverney, the young lady I told you
of, on whose estate I was born, and her maid Nicole. Excuse
me troubling you with such matters, but you drive me to it.
This is the lady whom I love more than you ever loved all
your flames. It is she whom I followed afoot, penniless and
wanting bread, until I fell exhausted on the highway and
racked with pain. It is she whom I saw once more yesterday
at St. Denis, and behind whose coach I came till I housed her
in the place yonder. In short, it is she for whom I wish one
of these days to be a great man&mdash;a Rousseau!"</p>

<p>His hearer knew the human heart, and the gamut of its exclamations.
The best actor could hardly have Gilbert's tearful
voice and the feverish gesture accompanying the effusion.</p>

<p>"So this is your lady love?"</p>

<p>"My foster-sister, yes."</p>

<p>"Then you lied a while ago when you said you knew her
not, and you are a liar, if not a traitor."</p>

<p>"You are racking my heart and you would hurt me less
were you to slay me on the spot."</p>

<p>"Pooh! that is a mere piece of fustian out of the Diderot or
Marmontel books. You are a liar, sir."</p>

<p>"Have it so, and the worse for you that you do not understand
such white lies!" retorted Gilbert. "I shall go, heartbroken,
and you will have my despair on your conscience."</p>

<p>Rousseau smoothed his chin and regarded the youth whose
case had so much analogy with his own.</p>

<p>"He is either a great rogue or a lad with a big heart," he
mused; "but after all, if he is in a plot against me, it will be
best to have the wires of the puppets in my hand."</p>

<p>Gilbert strode to the door, but he paused with his hand on
the knob, waiting for the last word to recall or banish him.</p>

<p>"Enough on this head, my son," said the man of letters.
"It is hard enough for you to be in love, to this degree. But
it is getting on, and we have thirty pages of music to copy
this day. Look alive, Gilbert, look alive!"</p>

<p>Gilbert grasped the speaker's hand and pressed it to his lips
as he would not a king's. While Gilbert leaned up against
the doorjamb with emotion, Rousseau took a last peep out of
the window. This was the moment when Andrea stood up to
put on her dress, but seeing a person up at the attic window,
she darted back and bade Nicole shut the sashes.</p>

<p>"My old head frightened her," mumbled the philosopher;
"his youthful one would not have done that. Oh, youth,
lovely youth!" he broke forth, sighing, "'Spring is the love-time
of the year! love is the springtime of life!'"</p>

<p>Hanging up the dress, he melancholically descended the<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>
stairs at the heels of Gilbert, for whose youth he would at
that time have bartered his reputation, at that juncture counterbalancing
Voltaire's and with it sharing the admiration of
the entire world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">BALSAMO AT HOME.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> house in St. Claude Street, to which Joseph Balsamo
invited the Cardinal Prince of Rohan did not look strange in
his day, but it resembled a fortress to such an extent that it
would be remarkable at present. Strongly built, and with
barred windows and grated doors, to say nothing of the ditch
in front and high balconies, it was in keeping with this part
of the town, pretty unsafe at this epoch after dark.</p>

<p>There were scarcely a dozen houses on the quarter of a
league to the Bastille, and the municipal authorities did not
think it worth while to supply lamps. Along this deserted
and unlighted highway a carriage was driven after nine
one evening, which stopped at the low, deep doorway where
gleamed the brazen griffin for a knocker which Count Fenix
had described.</p>

<p>The arms of the nobleman were on the carriage panels. He
preceded it by some yards, riding Djerid, who whisked his
long tail till it whistled in the dust of the dirty pavement.</p>

<p>Behind the closed blinds slumbered Lorenza on the cushions.</p>

<p>At the rolling of the wheels, the door opened as by enchantment,
and the carriage vanished in the black gulf of the mansion
courtyard.</p>

<p>There was no need of any mystery, for nobody was about to
see the count come home or mark what he brought, even if it
were the treasure-chest of St. Denis Abbey.</p>

<p>A skillful calculator, given the size of the building lot and
that of the house on street, would be surprised how so
small a one covered so much ground. The fact of the matter
was that there stood a house behind the outer house, known
only to the tenant.</p>

<p>A German servant, aged about thirty; closed the coachway
door and bolted it. Opening the coach door while the emotionless
driver unharnessed the team, he drew from within the
senseless Lorenza, whom he carried indoors to an antechamber.
He laid her on a table and discreetly wrapped her in her
long veil to the feet.</p>

<p>He went out to light at the coach lamps a seven-candle
chandelier, with which he came back.</p>

<p>During that short space, Lorenza had disappeared.</p>

<p>In fact Count Fenix had entered after the valet went out.
He had taken up the girl in his arms, and carried her out by<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>
a secret passage into a room furnished with trophies of outlandish
weapons.</p>

<p>With his foot he pressed the spring of the backplate of the
high fireplace, which turned on well-oiled hinges, so that the
count could go forth, as he did, while the secret panel slid to
behind him.</p>

<p>On the other side of the chimney was another flight of steps.
Mounting a dozen, covered with Utrecht velvet carpet, he
reached the sill of a room elegantly tapestried with satin, so
wonderfully embroidered in high relief with flowers in their
natural colors that they seemed real.</p>

<p>The extremely rich furniture was of a boudoir and toilet
chamber leading to a parlor.</p>

<p>Curtains hid two windows, but as it was night, they were
not wanted to give light. Lamps burning perfumed oil burnt
here night and day, for the room had no external openings.
They were drawn up through apertures in the ceiling by unseen
hands when they needed replenishing.</p>

<p>Not a sound penetrated here, and one might feel as a thousand
miles out of the world. But gilding flashed on all sides and
Bohemian glass mirrors sparkled as, dissatisfied with the light,
after having placed Lorenza on a sofa, the count struck a fire
with the silver phosphorus matchbox so startling to Gilbert,
and kindled two pink candled chandeliers on the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>Returning to Lorenza, and kneeling with one knee on a pile
of cushions beside her, he called her by name. Though her
eyes remained closed, she rose on one elbow, but without
replying.</p>

<p>"Are you sleeping naturally or through the magnetic
spell?"</p>

<p>"Lorenza sleeps in the magnetic sleep," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then you can answer my questions. Look into the room
of the Princess Louise which we have just quitted, and tell me
if the Cardinal of Rohan is there."</p>

<p>"No; the abbess is praying before going to rest."</p>

<p>"Look through the house for the cardinal. Is his carriage
at the door? Is it on the road? Come along nearer to Paris,
as we drove. Nearer!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I see it! It has stopped at the tollbar. A footman
gets down to speak with his <a name="tn_png_167"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "master." on Page 165-->master."</p>

<p>"List to him, Lorenza, for it is important that I should
know what the cardinal says to this man."</p>

<p>"You did not order me to listen in time, for he has done
speaking to the man. But the man speaks to the coachman,
who is told to drive to St. Claude Street, in the swamp, by the
rampart road."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lorenza."</p>

<p>The count went to the wall, pulled aside an ornament
which disclosed an ivory mouthpiece and spoke some words<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
in a tube of unknown length and direction; it was his way of
corresponding here with his man of trust, Fritz.</p>

<p>"Are you content with me?" asked the medium.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Lorenza, and here is your reward," he said,
giving her a fond caress.</p>

<p>"Oh, Joseph, how I love you!" she said with an almost
painful sigh.</p>

<p>Her arms opened to enfold Balsamo on her heart.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">THE DOUBLE EXISTENCE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">But</span> he recoiled swiftly, and the arms came together ere
falling folded on her bosom.</p>

<p>"Would you like to speak with your friend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, speak to me often. I like to hear your voice."</p>

<p>"You have often told me, dearest, that you would be very
happy if we could dwell together afar from the world."</p>

<p>"That would indeed be bliss."</p>

<p>"Well, I have realized your wish, darling. We are by
ourselves in this parlor, where none can hear and none intrude."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"Tell me how you like the place."</p>

<p>"Order me to see it."</p>

<p>"Does it please you?" asked the count, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes; here are my favorite flowers. Thank you, my kind
Joseph. How good you are!"</p>

<p>"I do all I can to please you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a hundred times kinder to me than I deserve."</p>

<p>"You confess that you have been wicked?"</p>

<p>"Very badly so, but you will overlook that?"</p>

<p>"After you explain the enigma which I have struggled
against ever since I knew you."</p>

<p>"Hearken, Balsamo. In me are two Lorenzas, quite distinct.
One loves you and the other detests you, as if I lived
two existences. One during which I enjoy the delights of
paradise, the other when I suffer the opposite."</p>

<p>"These two existences are your waking mood and your
magnetic sleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why do you hate me when in your waking senses and
love me when in the charmed sleep?"</p>

<p>"Because Lorenza is the superstitious Italian girl who believes
that science is a crime and love a sin. Then she is
afraid of the sage Balsamo and the loving Joseph. She has
been told that to love would destroy her soul; and so she
flees from the lover to the confines of the earth."</p>

<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>

<p>"But when Lorenza sleeps?"</p>

<p>"It is another matter. She is no longer a Roman girl and
superstitious, but a woman. She sees that the genius of Balsamo
dreams of sublime themes. She understands how petty
an object she is compared with him. She longs to live by him
and die at his side, in order that the future shall breathe her
name while it trumpets the glory of&mdash;Cagliostro."</p>

<p>"Is that the name I am to be celebrated under?"</p>

<p>"The name."</p>

<p>"Dear Lorenza! so you like our new home?"</p>

<p>"It is richer than any you have found for me; but that is
not why I like it more&mdash;but because you say you will be
oftener with me here."</p>

<p>"So, when you sleep, you know how fondly I adore
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said with a faint smile, "I see that passion,
then, and yet there is something you love above Lorenza,"
she sighed. "Your dream."</p>

<p>"Rather say, my task."</p>

<p>"Well, your ambition!"</p>

<p>"Say, my glory."</p>

<p>"Oh, heaven!" and her heart was laboring; her closed lids
allowed tears to struggle out.</p>

<p>"What is it you see?" inquired Balsamo, astounded at the
lucidity which frightened even him.</p>

<p>"I see phantoms gliding about among the shadows. Some
hold in their own hands their severed crowned heads, like St.
Denis in that Abbey; and you stand in the heart of the battle
like a general in command. You seem to rule, and you are
obeyed."</p>

<p>"Does that not make you proud of me?" inquired the other
joyfully.</p>

<p>"You are good enough not to care to be great. Besides, in
looking for myself in this scene, I see nothing of me. Oh, I
shall not be there," she sighed. "I shall be in the grave."</p>

<p>"You dead, my dearest Lorenza!" said Balsamo, frowning.
"No, we shall live and love together."</p>

<p>"No, you love me no more, or not enough," crowding
upon his forehead, held between her hands, a multitude of
glowing kisses. "I have to reproach you for your coldness.
Look now how you draw away from me as though you fled
my fondlings. Oh, restore to me my maiden quietude, in my
nunnery of Subiaco&mdash;when the night was so calm in my cell.
Return me those kisses which you sent on the wings of the
wind coming to me in my solitude like golden-pinioned sylph,
which melted on me in delight. Do not retreat from me.
Give me your hand, that I may press it; let me kiss your dear
eyes&mdash;let me be your wife, in short."</p>

<p>"Lorenza, sweetest, you are my well-beloved wife."</p>

<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>

<p>"Yet you pass by the chaste and solitary flower and scorn
the perfume? I am sure that I am nothing to you."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, you are everything&mdash;my Lorenza. For
it is you who give me strength, power and genius&mdash;without
you I should be nothing. Cease, then, to love me with this
insensate fever which wrecks the nights of your people, and
love me as I love you. Thus I am happy."</p>

<p>"You call that happiness?" scornfully said the Italian.</p>

<p>"Yes, for to be great is happiness."</p>

<p>She heaved a long sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you only knew the gladness in being able to read
the hearts of man and manipulate them with the strings of
their own dominant passions."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that in this I serve your purpose."</p>

<p>"It is not all. Your eyes read the sealed book of the
future. You, sweet dove, pure and guideless, you have taught
me what I could not ascertain in twenty years' application.
You enlighten my steps, before which my enemies multiply
traps and snares; on my mind depend my life, fortune and
liberty&mdash;you dilate it like the lynx's eye which sees in the
dark. As your lovely orbs close on this world, they open in
superhuman clarity. They watch for me. It is you who
make me rich, free and powerful."</p>

<p>"And in return, you make me unhappy," replied Lorenza,
wrapped up in her frenzy.</p>

<p>More fiery than ever, she enfolded him in her arms, so that
he was impregnated with a flame which he feebly resisted.
But he made such an effort that he broke the living bondage.</p>

<p>"Have pity, Lorenza!" he sued.</p>

<p>"Was it to pity you that I left my native land, my name,
my family, my faith!" she said, almost threatening with her
lovely arms, rising white and yet muscular amid the waves of
her long black tresses coming down. "Why have you laid
on me this absolute empire, so that if I am your slave and
have to give you my life and breath? Was it to mock me ever
with the name of the virgin Lorenza?"</p>

<p>Balsamo sighed, himself crushed by the weight of her immense
despair.</p>

<p>"Alas, is it your fault, or that of the Creator. Why were
you made the angel with the infallible gaze, by whose aid I
should make the universe submit? Why is it that you are the
one to read a soul through its bodily envelope as one may read
a book through a glass! Because you are an angel of purity,
Lorenza, and nothing throws a shadow upon your soul. In
your radiant and immaculate bosom the divine spark may be
enshrined, a place without sullying where it may fitly nestle.
You are a seer because you are blameless, Lorenza; as a
woman, you would be but so much substance."</p>

<p>"And you prefer this to my love," continued the Italian,<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
clapping her hands with such rage that they became impurpled;
"you set my love beneath these whims that you pursue
and fables that you invent? You snatch me out of the cold
cloister, but, in the bustling, ardent world you condemn me
to the conventional chastity? Joseph, you commit a crime,
I tell you."</p>

<p>"Do not blaspheme," said Balsamo, "for I suffer, too.
Read in my heart, and never again say that I love you not.
I resist you because I want to raise you on the throne of the
world."</p>

<p>"Ugh, your ambition!" sneered the young Roman; "will
your ambition ever give you what you might have in my
love?"</p>

<p>He yielded to her and his head rested in her arms.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she cried, "I see at last that you love me more
than your ambition, than power, than your aspiration! Oh,
you love me as I love you!"</p>

<p>But at the touch of their lips, reason came to him who
would be master of Europe. With his hands he beat aside the
air charged with magnetic vapor.</p>

<p>"Lorenza, awake, I bid you!"</p>

<p>Thereupon the chain which he could not break was relaxed,
and the opening arms were dropped, while the kiss died away
on the paling lips of Lorenza, languishing in her last sigh.
Her closed eyes parted their lids; the dilated pupils resumed
their normal size. She shook herself with an effort, and sank
in lassitude, but awake, on the sofa.</p>

<p>Seated three paces from her, the mesmerist sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Good-bye to the dream!" he said; "good-bye to happiness!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE WAKEFUL STATE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">As</span> soon as Lorenza's sight had recovered its power, she
glanced rapidly around her. After examining everything
without one of the many knick-knacks which delight woman
brightening her brow, she stopped with her look upon Balsamo,
and nervously shuddered.</p>

<p>"You again?" she said, receding.</p>

<p>On her physiognomy appeared all the tokens of alarm; her
lips became white and perspiration came as pearls at the root
of her hair.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she asked as he said nothing.</p>

<p>"As you know where you came from, you can readily
guess where you are," he responded.</p>

<p>"You are right in reminding me; I do, indeed, remember.
I know that I have been pursued by you, and torn from the
arms of the royal intermediary whom I chose between
heaven and you."</p>

<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>

<p>"Then you ought to know that this princess has been
unable to defend you, however powerful she may be."</p>

<p>"You have overruled her by some witching violence,"
said Lorenza, wringing her hands, "Oh, saints of mercy,
deliver me from this demon!"</p>

<p>"Where do you see anything demoniacal in me," returned
Balsamo, shrugging his shoulders. "Once for all I
beg you to lay aside this pack of puerile beliefs brought from
Rome, and all the rubbish of absurd superstitions which you
have carted about with you since you ran away from the
nunnery."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear nunnery&mdash;who will restore me to my dear
nunnery?" cried the Italian, bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"Indeed, a nunnery is much to be deplored," said Balsamo.</p>

<p>Lorenza ran to one of the windows, opened the curtains and
then the sash, but came against iron bars, which were there
unmistakably&mdash;however many flowers were masking them.</p>

<p>"If I must live in a prison," she said, "I prefer that
whence one goes to heaven to that which has a trap door into
hades." And she began trying the bars with her dainty
hands.</p>

<p>"Were you more reasonable, Lorenza, you would find only
flowers at your window, and not bars."</p>

<p>"Was I not reasonable when you confined me in that other
prison, the one on wheels, with the vampire you call Althotas?
But still you kept your eye on me when by, and
never left me till you had breathed into me that spirit which
possesses me and I cannot shake it off. Where is that horrid
old man who frightens me to death? In some corner, I suppose.
Let us hush and listen till his ghostly voice be heard."</p>

<p>"You let your fancy sway you, like a child," said Balsamo.
"My friend and preceptor, Althotas, my second
father, is an inoffensive old man who has never seen you,
let alone approached you, or if he did come near, he would
not heed you, being absorbed in his work."</p>

<p>"His work&mdash;tell me what the work is!" muttered the
Roman.</p>

<p>"He is seeking the elixir of long life, for which superior
minds have been seeking these two thousand years."</p>

<p>"What are you working for?"</p>

<p>"Human perfection."</p>

<p>"A pair of demons!" said Lorenza, lifting her hands to
heaven.</p>

<p>"Is this your fit coming on again? You are ignorant of
one thing: your life is divided into two parts. During one,
you are gentle, good and sensible: during the other, you are
mad."</p>

<p>"And you shut me up under the vain pretext of this
malady."</p>

<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>

<p>"It had to be done."</p>

<p>"Oh, barbarian, be cruel, without pity! imprison me, and
kill me, but do not play the hypocrite and pretend to feel for
me while you tear me to pieces."</p>

<p>"Do you call it torture to live in a luxurious suite of
rooms?" said Balsamo with a kindly smile and not at all
disturbed.</p>

<p>"With bars to all the issues!"</p>

<p>"Put there for the sake of your life, Lorenza."</p>

<p>"Oh, he roasts me to death at a slow fire, and he talks of
my life's sake!" exclaimed the Italian.</p>

<p>Approaching, he offered to take her hand, but she repelled
his as if it were a serpent.</p>

<p>"Do not touch me!" she said.</p>

<p>"Do you hate me so much, Lorenza!"</p>

<p>"Ask the victim how he likes the executioner."</p>

<p>"It is because I do not want to be one that I restrict your
liberty a little. Could you come and go as you like, who
can tell what your folly might drive you to."</p>

<p>"Wait till I am free some day, and see what I shall do!"</p>

<p>"Lorenza, you are behaving badly toward the husband
whom you chose. You are my wife."</p>

<p>"That was the work of Satan."</p>

<p>"Poor crazy creature!" said the mesmerist, with a tender
look.</p>

<p>"I am a daughter of Rome," continued she, "and some day
I shall take revenge."</p>

<p>"Do you say that merely to frighten me?" he asked, gently
shaking his head.</p>

<p>"No, no; I will do what I say."</p>

<p>"What are you saying&mdash;and you a Christian woman?" exclaimed
Balsamo with surprising authority in his voice. "Is
your creed which bids you return good for evil but a hypocrisy,
that you pretend to follow it, and you boast of revenge&mdash;evil
for good?"</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Lorenza, for an instant struck by the argument.
"It is duty, not revenge, to denounce society's
enemies."</p>

<p>"If you denounced me as a master in the black art, it
would be not be as an offender against society, but against
heaven. Were I to defy heaven, which need but comprise
me as one atom in the myriads slain by an earthquake or
pestilence, but which takes no pains to punish me, why should
weak men like myself undertake to punish me?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forgets, or tolerates&mdash;waiting for you to reform,"
said the Italian.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," said the other, smiling, "you are advised to
tolerate your husband, friend and benefactor?"</p>

<p>"Husband? Oh, that I should have to endure your yoke!"</p>

<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>

<p>"Oh, what an impenetrable mystery?" muttered the magician,
pursuing his thought rather than heeding the speaker.</p>

<p>"Let us have done. Why do you take away my liberty?"</p>

<p>"Why, having bestowed it on me, would you take it back?
Why flee from your protector? <a name="tn_png_174"></a><!--TN: "why" changed to "Why" on Page 172-->Why unceasingly threaten one
who never threatens you, with revelation of secrets which are
not yours and have aims beyond anything you can conceive?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Lorenza, without replying to the question,
"the prisoner who yearns for <a name="tn_png_174a"></a><!--TN: "fredom" changed to "freedom" on Page 172-->freedom eventually obtains it,
and your house bars will no more hold me than your wagon-sides."</p>

<p>"Happily for you, they are stout," replied Balsamo, with
ominous tranquillity.</p>

<p>"Heaven will send another such storm as befel us in Lorraine,
and some thunderbolt will shatter them."</p>

<p>"Take my advice to pray for nothing of the kind,
Lorenza; distrust these romantic transports: I speak to you
as a friend&mdash;listen to me."</p>

<p>Stunned at the height of her rebellion, Lorenza listened in
spite of herself, from so much concentrated wrath being in
his voice, and gloomy fire in his eye, while his white but
powerful hand opened and shut so strangely as he slowly and
solemnly spoke:</p>

<p>"Mark this, my child, that I have tried to have this place
fit for a queen, with nothing lacking for your comfort. So
calm your folly. Live here as you would do in your convent
cell. You must become habituated to my presence. As I
have great sorrows, I will confide in you; dreadful disappointment,
for which I will crave a smile. The kinder, more
patient and attentive you are, the more of your bars I will
remove, so that in some months&mdash;who knows how soon?&mdash;you
will become perhaps more free than I am, in the sense that
you will not want to curtail my liberty."</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the Italian, unable to understand that
firm resolution could be allied to such gentle words, "no more
professions and falsehoods. You abducted me, so that I
am my own property still; restore me to heaven, if you will
not let me be my own mistress. I have borne with your despotism
so far from remembering that you saved me from the
robbers who would have ruined me; but this gratitude is
much enfeebled. A few days more of this captivity against
which I revolt, and I shall no longer feel obliged to you; a
few more, and I shall perhaps believe you were in concert
with those highwaymen."</p>

<p>"So you honor me with a captaincy of brigands," sneered
Balsamo.</p>

<p>"I do not know about that, but I noticed secret signs and
peculiar words."</p>

<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>

<p>"But," replied the other, losing color, "you will never tell
them; never to a living soul? You will bury them in the remotest
place in your memory so that they shall die there,
smothered."</p>

<p>"Just the other way," retorted Lorenza, delighted as angry
persons are at having found the antagonist's vulnerable point.
"My memory shall piously preserve those words, which I will
repeat over and over again when alone, and say aloud when
the opening comes, as already I have done."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To the princess royal."</p>

<p>"Lorenza, mind this well," said he, clenching his nails in
his flesh to subdue his fury and check his rushing blood at
the thought that his brothers were in danger through the
woman whom he had selected to aid them all, "if you said
them, never again will you do so. For the doors will be kept
fastened, those bars pointed at the head, and those walls
reared as high as Babel's."</p>

<p>"I have already told you, Balsamo, that any soul wherein
the love of liberty is reinforced by the hate of tyranny
must escape from all prison houses."</p>

<p>"Well and good; try it, woman; but mark this well: you
will only twice try it. For the first time I will punish you so
severely that you will weep all the tears in your body; and
for the second I will strike you pitilessly that you will pour
forth all the blood in your veins."</p>

<p>"Help, <a name="tn_png_175"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "help," on Page 173-->help, he is murdering me," shrieked the woman,
at the last paroxysm of wrath, tearing her hair and rolling on
the carpet.</p>

<p>For an instant Balsamo considered her with mingled rage
and pity, the latter overcoming the other.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Lorenza, return to your senses, and be calm.
A day will come when you will be rewarded amply for what
you have suffered, or fancy."</p>

<p>"Imprisoned," screamed the Italian, "and beaten."</p>

<p>"These are times to try the mind. You are mad, but you
shall be cured."</p>

<p>"Better throw me into a madhouse at once; shut me up in
a real jail."</p>

<p>"No, you have warned me what you would do against
me."</p>

<p>"Then," said the infuriate, "let me have death straightway."</p>

<p>Springing up with the suppleness and rapidity of the wild
beast, she leaped to break her head against the wall. But
Balsamo had merely to stretch out his hands toward her and
utter a single word rather with his will than with his lips, to
stop her dead. She stopped, indeed, reeled and dropped sleep-stricken
in the magnetiser's arms.</p>

<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>

<p>The strange enchanter, who seemed to rule all the material
part of the woman though the mental portion baffled him,
lifted up Lorenza in his arms and carried her to the couch;
there he laid a long kiss on her lips, drew the curtains of bed
and windows, and left her.</p>

<p>A sweet and blessed sleep enveloped her like the cloak of a
kind mother wrapping the willful child who has much suffered
and wept.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE PREDICTED VISIT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Lorenza</span> was not mistaken.</p>

<p>A carriage, going through St. Denis gateway, and following
the street of the same name, turned into the road leading out
to the Bastille.</p>

<p>As the clairvoyant had stated, this conveyance enclosed
the Cardinal Prince of Rohan, Bishop of Strasburg, whose
impatience had caused him to anticipate the hour fixed for his
visit to the magician in his cave of mystery.</p>

<p>The coachman, who had been inured to obscurity, pitfalls
and dangers of some darksome streets by the prelate's love
adventures, was not daunted the least when, after leaving the
part of the way still populated and lighted, he had to take the
black and lonesome Bastille Boulevard.</p>

<p>The vehicle stopped at the corner of St. Claude Street, where
it hid along the trees twenty paces off.</p>

<p>Prince Rohan, in plain dress, glided up the street, and
rapped three times on the door, which he easily recognized
from the indication the count had afforded.</p>

<p>Fritz's steps sounded in the passage, and he opened the
door.</p>

<p>"Is it here resides Count Fenix?" inquired Rohan.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, and he is at home."</p>

<p>"Say a visitor is here."</p>

<p>"Shall I announce his Eminence Cardinal Prince de Rohan?"
asked Fritz.</p>

<p>The prince stood aghast, looking round him and at himself
to see if anything about him in costume or surroundings
betrayed his rank. No; he was alone and in civilian dress.</p>

<p>"How do you know my name?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"My lord told me just now, that he expected your
Eminence."</p>

<p>"Yes, but to-morrow, or the day after?"</p>

<p>"Not so, please your highness&mdash;this evening."</p>

<p>"Announce me, any way," said the prelate, putting a
double-louis gold piece in his hand.</p>

<p>Fritz intimated that the visitor should follow him; and he
walked briskly to the door of the ante-chamber, which a large<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>
chandelier with a dozen tapers illuminated. The visitor followed,
surprised and meditative.</p>

<p>"There must be some mistake, my friend," he said, pausing
at the door, "in which case I do not wish to disturb the
count. It is impossible he can expect me, as he could not
know I was coming."</p>

<p>"As your highness is Cardinal Prince Rohan, you are certainly
expected by my lord."</p>

<p>Lighting the other candelabra, Fritz bowed and went out.
Five minutes elapsed, during which the prelate, the prey to
singular emotion, scanned the elegant furniture of the room,
and the half-dozen paintings by masters on the tapestried
walls. When the door opened, Count Fenix appeared on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Good-evening to your highness," he simply said.</p>

<p>"I am told that you expected me," observed the visitor,
without replying to the welcome. "Expected this evening?
impossible!"</p>

<p>"I ask your pardon, but I was expecting your highness,"
returned the host. "I may be doubted, seeing how paltry is
my reception, but I have hardly got settled yet, from being
but a few days in town. I hope for your eminence's excusing
me."</p>

<p>"My visit expected? Who could have forewarned you?"</p>

<p>"Yourself, my lord. When you called your footman to
the carriage door, did you not say to him: 'Drive to St.
Claude Street, in the Swamp, by St. Denis Street and the
Boulevard?'&mdash;words which he repeated to the <a name="tn_png_177"></a><!--TN: Period changed to a question mark followed by a quote after "driver" on Page 175-->driver?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but how could you see this and hear the words, not
being present?"</p>

<p>"I was not there, but I saw and heard at this distance, as I
am, you must not forget, a wizard."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten. By the way, am I to entitle you Baron
Balsamo or Count Fenix!"</p>

<p>"In my own house I have no title&mdash;I am plainly The
<span class="smcap">Master</span>."</p>

<p>"Ah, the title in alchemy. So, my master in hermetics, if
you expected me, the fire would be lit in the laboratory!"</p>

<p>"The fire is always kept burning, my lord. And I will
have the honor to show your highness into the place."</p>

<p>"I follow you on the condition that you do not personally
confront me with the devil. I am dreadfully afraid of his
Satanic Majesty Lucifer."</p>

<p>"My lord, my familiar friends," replied Balsamo, "never
forget how to deal with princes, and they will behave properly."</p>

<p>"This encourages me; so, ho! for the laboratory."</p>

<span class="chapterhead">THE ART OF MAKING GOLD.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> two threaded a narrow staircase which led, as did the
grand stairs, to the first floor rooms, but a door was under an
archway there, which the guide opened and the cardinal
bravely walked into a dark corridor thus disclosed.</p>

<p>Balsamo shut the door, and the sound of the closing made
the visitor look back with some emotion.</p>

<p>"We have arrived," said the leader. "Only one door to
open and shut behind us. Do not be astonished at the noise it
makes, as it is of iron."</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the cardinal was warned in time, for
the snap of the handle and the grinding of the hinges might
make nerves more susceptible than his to vibrate.</p>

<p>They went down three steps and entered a large cell with
rafters overhead, a huge lamp with shade, many books, and
a number of chemical and physical instruments&mdash;such was
the aspect.</p>

<p>In a few seconds the cardinal felt a difficulty in breathing.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, my lord?" he asked. "The water
is streaming off me and I am stifling. What sound is that,
master?"</p>

<p>"This is the cause," answered the host, pulling aside a
large curtain of asbestos, and uncovering a large brick furnace
in the centre of which glared two fiery cavities like lions'
eyes in the gloom.</p>

<p>This furnace stood in an inner room, centrally, twice the
size of the first, unseen from the stone-cloth screen.</p>

<p>"This is rather alarming, meseems," said the prince.</p>

<p>"Only a furnace, my lord."</p>

<p>"But there are different kinds of furnaces; this one strikes
me as diabolical, and the smell is not pleasant. What devil's
broth are you cooking?"</p>

<p>"What your eminence wants. I believe you will accept a
sample of my produce. I was not going to work until
to-morrow; but as your eminence changed his mind, I lit the
fire as soon as I saw you on the road hither. I made the mixture
so that the furnace is boiling, and you can have your gold
in about ten minutes. Let me open the ventilator to let in
some air."</p>

<p>"What, are these crucibles on the fire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In ten minutes they will pour you out the gold as pure as
from any assayer's in christendom."</p>

<p>"I should like to look at them."</p>

<p>"Of course, you can; but you must take the indispensable<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>
precaution of putting on this asbestos mask with glass eyes;
or the ardent fire will scorch your sight."</p>

<p>"Have a care, indeed! I prize my eyes, and would not
give them for the hundred thousand crowns you promised me."</p>

<p>"So I thought, and your lordship's eyes are good and
bright."</p>

<p>The compliment did not displease the prince, who was proud
of his personal advantages.</p>

<p>"He, he!" he chuckled; "so we are going to see gold made?"</p>

<p>"I expect so, my lord."</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand crowns' worth?"</p>

<p>"There may be a little more, as I mixed up liberally the raw
stuff."</p>

<p>"You are certainly a generous magician," said the prince,
fastening the fireproof mask on, while his heart throbbed
gladly.</p>

<p>"Less than your eminence, though it is kind to praise me
for generosity, of which you are a good judge. Will your
highness stand a little one side while I lift off the crucible
covers?"</p>

<p>He had put on a stone-cloth shirt, and seizing iron pincers,
he lifted off an iron cover. This allowed one to see four
similar melting pots, each containing a fluid mass, one vermilion
red, others lighter but all ruddy.</p>

<p>"Is that gold?" queried the prelate in an undertone, as if
afraid by loud speaking to injure the mystery in progress.</p>

<p>"Yes, the four crucibles contain the metal in different
stages of production, some having been on eleven hours, some
twelve. The mixture is to be thrown into the first mass of
ingredients&mdash;the living stuff into the gross&mdash;at the moment of
boiling&mdash;that is the secret, which I do not mind communicating
to a friend of the science. But, as your eminence may
notice, the first crucible is turning white hot; it is time to
draw the charge. Will you please stand well back, my
lord?"</p>

<p>Rohan obeyed with the same punctuality as a soldier obeying
his captain. Dropping the iron pincers, which had already
heated to redness, the other ran up to the furnace a carriage
on wheels of the same level, the top being an iron
block, in which were set eight molds of round shape and
the same capacity.</p>

<p>"This is the mold in which I cast the ingots," explained
the alchemist.</p>

<p>On the floor he spread a lot of wet oakum wads to prevent
the splashing of the metal setting the floor afire. He placed
himself between the molds and the furnace, opened a large
book, from which he read an incantation, and said, as he
caught up long tongs in his hand to clutch the crucible:</p>

<p>"The gold will be splendid, my lord, of the first quality."</p>

<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>

<p>"Oh, you are never going to lift that mass single-handed?"
exclaimed the spectator.</p>

<p>"Though it weighs fifty pounds, yes, my lord; but do not
fear, for few metal-melters have my strength and skill."</p>

<p>"But if the crucible were to burst&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That did happen once to me: it was in 1399, while I was
experimenting with Nicolas Flamel, in his house by St.
Jacques' in the Shambles. Poor Nick almost lost his life, and
I lost twenty-seven marks' worth of a substance more precious
than gold."</p>

<p>"What the deuse are you telling me? that you were pursuing
the great work in 1399 with Nicolas Flamel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Flamel and I found the way while together fifty or
sixty years before, working with Pietro the Good, in Pela
town. He did not pour out the crucible quickly enough, and
I had a bad eye, the left one, for ten or twelve years, from
the steam. Of course you know Pietro's book, the famous
'Margarita Pretiosa,' dated 1330?"</p>

<p>"To be sure; and you knew Flamel and Peter the Good?"</p>

<p>"I was the pupil of one and the master of the other."</p>

<p>While the alarmed prelate, wondered whether this might
not be the Prince of Darkness himself and not one of his imps
by his side, Balsamo plunged his tongs into the incandescence.</p>

<p>It was a sure and rapid seizure. He nipped the crucible
four inches beneath the rim, testing the grip by lifting it just
a couple of inches. Then, by a vigorous effort, straining his
muscles, he raised the frightful pot from the scorching bed.
The tongs reddened almost up to the grasp. On the superheated
surface white streaks ran like lightning in a sulphurous
cloud. The pot edges deepened into brick red, then browner,
while its conical shape appeared rosy and silvery in the
twilight of the recess. Finally the molten metal could be
spied, forming a violet cream on the top, with golden shivers,
which hissed out of the lips of the container, and leaped flaming
into the black mold. At its orifice reappeared the gold,
spouting up furious and fuming, as if insulted by the vile
metal which confined it.</p>

<p>"Number two," said <a name="tn_png_180"></a><!--TN: "Balsmo" changed to "Balsamo" on Page 178-->Balsamo, passing to the second mold,
which he filled with the same skill and strength.</p>

<p>Perspiration streamed from the founder, while the beholder
crossed himself, in the shadow.</p>

<p>It was truly a picture of wild and majestic horror. Illumined
by the yellow gleams of the metallic flame, the operator
resembled the condemned souls writhing in the Infernos of
Dante and Michelangelo, in their caldrons. Add to this the
sensation of what was in progress being unheard-of. Balsamo
did not stop to take breath between the two drawings of the
charges, for time pressed.</p>

<p>"There is little loss," observed he, after filling the second<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>
mold. "I let the boiling go on the hundredth of a minute
too long."</p>

<p>"The hundredth of a minute?" repeated the cardinal, not
trying to conceal his stupefaction.</p>

<p>"Trifles are enormous in the hermetical art," replied the
magician simply; "but anyway, here are two crucibles empty
and two ingots cast, and they amount to a hundred weight of
fine gold."</p>

<p>Seizing the first mold with the powerful tongs, he threw
it into a tub of water, which seethed and steamed for a long
time; at length he opened it, and drew out an ingot of purest
gold in the shape of a sugarloaf, flattened at both ends.</p>

<p>"We shall have to wait nearly an hour for the other two,"
said Balsamo. "While waiting, would your eminence not
like to sit down and breathe the fresh air?"</p>

<p>"And this is gold!" said the cardinal, without replying,
which made the hearer smile, for he had firm hold of him
now.</p>

<p>"Does your eminence doubt?"</p>

<p>"Science has so many times been deceived."</p>

<p>"You are not speaking your mind wholly," said Balsamo.
"You suppose that I cheat you, but do so with full knowledge.
My lord, I should look very small to myself if I acted thus,
for my ambition would then be restricted by the walls of this
foundry, whence you would go forth to give the rest of your
admiration to the first juggler at the street corner. Come,
come! honor me better, my prince, and take it that I would
cheat you more skillfully and with a higher aim if cheating
was intended by me. At all events your eminence knows how
to test gold?"</p>

<p>"By the touchstone, of course."</p>

<p>"Has not my lord made the application of the lunar caustic
to the Spanish gold coins much liked at card-play on account
of the gold being the finest, but among which a lot of counterfeits
have got afloat?"</p>

<p>"This indeed has happened me."</p>

<p>"Well, here is acid, and a bluestone, my lord."</p>

<p>"No, I am convinced."</p>

<p>"My lord, do me the pleasure of ascertaining that this is
not only gold, but gold without alloy."</p>

<p>The doubter seemed averse to giving this proof of unbelief,
and yet it was clear that he was not convinced. Balsamo
himself tested the ingots and showed the result to his guest.</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight karats fine," he said: "I am going to turn
out the other twain."</p>

<p>Ten minutes subsequently, the two hundred thousand
crowns' worth of the precious metal was lying on the damp
oakum bed, in four ingots altogether.</p>

<p>"I saw your <a name="tn_png_181"></a><!--TN: "emenience" changed to "eminence" on Page 179-->eminence coming in a carriage, so I presume<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>
it is in waiting. Let it be driven up to my door, and I will
have my man put the bullion in it."</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand crowns," muttered the prince, taking
off the mask in order to gloat on the metal at his feet.</p>

<p>"As you saw it made, you can freely say so," added the
conjurer, "but do not make a town talk of it, for wizards are
not liked in France. If I were making theories instead of
solid metal, it would be a different matter."</p>

<p>"Then what can I do for you?" questioned the prince,
with difficulty hoisting one of the fifty pound lumps in his
delicate hands.</p>

<p>The other looked hard at him and burst into laughter without
any respect.</p>

<p>"What is there laughable in the offer I make you?" asked
the cardinal.</p>

<p>"Why, your lordship offers me his services, and it seems
more to the purpose that I should offer mine."</p>

<p>"You oblige me," he said, with a clouding brow, "and
that I am eager to acknowledge. But if my gratitude ought
to be rated higher than I appraise it, I will not accept the service.
Thank heaven, there are still enough usurers in Paris
for me to find the hundred thousand crowns in a day, half on
my note of hand, half on security; my episcopal ring alone is
worth forty thousand livres."</p>

<p>Holding out his hand, white as a woman's, a diamond
flashed on the ring-finger as large as a hickory nut.</p>

<p>"Prince, you cannot possibly have held the idea for an
instant that I meant to insult you. It is strange that truth
seems to have this effect on all princes," he added, as to himself.
"Your eminence offers me his services; I ask you
yourself of what nature can they be?"</p>

<p>"My credit at court, to begin with."</p>

<p>"My lord, you know that is shaky, and I would rather
have the Duke of Choiseul's, albeit he may not be the prime
minister for yet a fortnight. Against your credit, look at my
cash&mdash;the pure, bright gold! Every time your eminence
wants some, advise me overnight or the same morning, and I
will conform to his desire. And with gold one obtains everything,
eh, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not everything," muttered the prince, falling from
the perch of patronage, and not even seeking to regain it.</p>

<p>"Quite right. I forgot that your eminence seeks something
else than gold, a more precious boon than all earthly gifts;
but that does not come within the scope of science as in the
range of magic. Say the word, my lord, and the alchemist
will become a magician, to serve you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I need nothing and desire no longer," sighed
the prelate.</p>

<p>"My lord," sighed the tempter, drawing nearer, "such a<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>
reply ought not to be made to a wizard by a prince, young, fiery,
handsome, rich and bearing the name of Rohan. Because the
wizard reads hearts and knows to the contrary."</p>

<p>"I wish for nothing," repeated the high nobleman, almost
frightened.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I thought that your eminence entertained
desires which he shrank from naming to himself, as they are
truly royal."</p>

<p>"I believe you are alluding to some words you used in the
Princess Royal's rooms?" said the prince, starting. "You
were in error then, and are so still."</p>

<p>"Your highness is forgetting that I see as clearly in your
heart what is going on now as I saw your carriage coming
from the Carmelite convent, traversing the town and stopping
under the trees fifty paces off from my house."</p>

<p>"Then explain what is there?"</p>

<p>"My lord, the princes of your house have always hungered
for a great and hazardous love affair."</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean, my lord," faltered the
prince.</p>

<p>"Nay, you understand to a T. I might have touched several
chords in you&mdash;but why the useless? I went straight to the
heartstring which sounds loudest, and it is vibrating deeply, I
am sure."</p>

<p>With a final effort of mistrust the cardinal raised his head
and interrogated the other's clear and sure gaze. The latter
smiled with such superiority that the cardinal lowered his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are right not to meet my glance, my lord, for
then I see into your heart too clearly. It is a mirror which retains
the image which it has reflected."</p>

<p>"Silence, Count Fenix; do be silent," said the prelate, subjugated.</p>

<p>"Silence?&mdash;you are right, for the time has not come to parade
such a passion."</p>

<p>"Not yet? may it expect a future?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"And can you tell me whether this is not a mad passion, as
I have thought, and must think until I have a proof to the
opposite?"</p>

<p>"You ask too much, my lord. I cannot say anything until
I am in contact with some portion of the love-inspirer's self&mdash;for
instance, a tress of her golden hair, however scanty."</p>

<p>"Verily you are a deep man! You truly say you can read
into hearts as I in my prayer-book."</p>

<p>"Almost the very words your ancestor used&mdash;I mean
Chevalier Louis Rohan, when I bade farewell to him, on the
execution-stage in the Bastille, which he had ascended so
courageously."</p>

<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>

<p>"He said that you were deep?"</p>

<p>"And that I read hearts. For I had forewarned him that
Chevalier Preault would betray him. He would not believe
me, and he was betrayed."</p>

<p>"What a singular connection you make between my ancestor
and me," said the cardinal, turning pale against his wish.</p>

<p>"Only to show that you ought to be wary, in procuring the
lock to be cut from under a crown."</p>

<p>"No matter whence it comes, you shall have it."</p>

<p>"Very well. Here is your gold; I hope you no longer
doubt that it is gold?"</p>

<p>"Give me pen and paper to write the receipt for this
generous loan."</p>

<p>"What do I want a receipt from your lordship for?"</p>

<p>"My dear count, I often borrow, but I never fail to write
a receipt," rejoined the prince.</p>

<p>"Have it your own way, my lord."</p>

<p>The cardinal took a quill and scrawled in large and illegible
writing a signature under a line or two which a schoolboy
would be ashamed of at present.</p>

<p>"Will that do?" he inquired, handing it to Balsamo, who
put it in his pocket without looking at it.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he said.</p>

<p>"You have not read it."</p>

<p>"I have the word of a Rohan, and that is better than a
bond."</p>

<p>"Count Fenix, you are truly a noble man, and I cannot
make you beholden to me. I am glad to be your debtor."</p>

<p>Balsamo bowed, and rang a bell, to which Fritz responded.</p>

<p>Saying a few words in German to him, the servant wrapped
up the ingots of gold in their wads of ropeyarn, and took them
all up as a boy might as many oranges in a handkerchief, a
little strained but not hampered or bent under the weight.</p>

<p>"Have we Hercules here?" questioned the cardinal.</p>

<p>"He is rather lusty, my lord," answered the necromancer,
"but I must own that, since he has been in my employment,
I make him drink three drops every morning of an elixir
which my learned friend Dr. Althotas compounded. It is
beginning to do him good. In a year he will be able to carry
a hundredweight on each finger."</p>

<p>"Marvelous! incomprehensible!" declared the prince-priest.
"Oh, I cannot resist the temptation to tell everybody about
this."</p>

<p>"Do so, my lord," replied the host, laughing. "But do not
forget that it is tantamount to pledging yourself to put out the
match when they start the fire going to burn me in public."</p>

<p>Having escorted his illustrious caller to the outer door, he
took his leave with a respectful bow.</p>

<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>

<p>"But I do not see your man," said the visitor.</p>

<p>"He went to carry the gold to your carriage, at the fourth
tree on the right round the corner on the main street. That
is what I told him in German, my lord."</p>

<p>The cardinal lifted his hands in wonder and disappeared in
the shadows.</p>

<p>Balsamo waited until Fritz returned, when he went back to
the private inner house, fastening all the doors.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">THE WATER OF LIFE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">He</span> went to listen at Lorenza's door, where she was sleeping
evenly and sweetly.</p>

<p>He opened a panel and looked in upon her, for some while
in affectionate reverie. Closing the wicket, he stole away to
his laboratory, where he put out the fire, by opening a register
plate which sent most of the heat up the chimney, and
ran in water from a tank without.</p>

<p>In a pocket-book, he carefully fastened up the receipt of
Cardinal Rohan, saying:</p>

<p>"The parole of a Rohan is all very well, but only for me,
and the brothers will want to know yonder how I employ
their money."</p>

<p>These words were dying on his lips when three sharp raps
on the ceiling made him lift his head.</p>

<p>"Althotas wants me, and in a hurry. That is a good
sign."</p>

<p>With a long iron rod he rapped in answer. He put away
the tools, and by means of an iron ring in a trap overhead,
which was the floor of a dumb-waiter, as then they called elevators,
he pulled this down to his feet. Placing himself in
the center of it, he was carried gently, by no spring but a
simple hydraulic machine, worked by the reservoir which had
extinguished the fire, up into the study reserved for the old
alchemist.</p>

<p>This new dwelling was eight feet by nine in height, and
sixteen in length; all the light came from a skylight, as the
four walls were without inlet. It was, relatively to the house
on wheels, a palace.</p>

<p>The old man was sitting in his easy-chair on casters, at the
middle of a horseshoe-shaped table in iron, with a marble top,
laden with a quantity of plants, books, tools, bottles, and
papers traced with cabalistic signs&mdash;a chaos.</p>

<p>He was so wrapt in thought that he was not disturbed by
the entrance.</p>

<p>A globe of crystal hung over his yellow and bald pate; in
this a sort of serpent, fine and coiled like a spring, seemed to
curl, and it sent forth a bright and unvarying light, without<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>
other apparent source of luminous supply than the chain supporting
the globe might contain to transmit.</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_186"></a><!--TN: Quote removed before "He" on Page 184-->He was "candling" a phial of ground glass in his fingers
as a good wife tries eggs.</p>

<p>"Well, anything new?" said Balsamo, after having silently
watched him for a while.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I am delighted, Acharat, for I have found what
I sought."</p>

<p>"Gold&mdash;diamonds?"</p>

<p>"Pooh! They are pretty discoveries for my soul to rejoice
over."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean your elixir, in that case."</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, my elixir&mdash;life everlasting."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you are still harping on that string," said the
younger sage sadly, for he thought his senior was following
an idle dream.</p>

<p>But without listening Althotas was lovingly peering into
his phial.</p>

<p>"The proportions are found at last," he mumbled. "Elixir
of Aristæus, twenty grams; balm of mercury, fifteen; precipitate
of gold, fifteen; essence of Lebanon cedar, twenty-five
grams."</p>

<p>"But it seems to me, bar the Aristæan elixir, this is about
what you last mixed up."</p>

<p>"That is so, but there was lacking the binding ingredient,
without which the rest are no good."</p>

<p>"Can one procure it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; it is three drops of a child's arterial blood."</p>

<p>"And have you the child?" gasped Balsamo, horrified.</p>

<p>"No, I expect you to find one for me."</p>

<p>"Master, you are mad."</p>

<p>"In what respect?" asked the emotionless old man, licking
with his tongue the stopper of the phial, from which a little
of the nectar had oozed.</p>

<p>"The child would be killed."</p>

<p>"What of it&mdash;the finer the child, the better the heart's
blood."</p>

<p>"It cannot be; children are no longer butchered, but
brought up with care."</p>

<p>"Indeed! how fickle is the world. Three years ago, we
were offered more children than we knew what to do with,
for four charges of gunpowder or a pint of traders'
whiskey."</p>

<p>"That was on the Congo River, in Africa, master."</p>

<p>"I believe so: but it does not matter if the young is black.
I remember that what they offered were sprightly, woolly-headed,
jolly little urchins."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately we are no longer on the Congo. We are
in Paris."</p>

<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>

<p>"Well, we can embark from Marseilles and be in Africa in
six weeks."</p>

<p>"That can be done; but I must stay in France on serious
business."</p>

<p>"Business?" sneered the old man, sending forth a peal of
shrill laughter, most lugubrious. "True, I had forgotten
that you have political clubs to organize, conspiracies to foster,
and, in short, serious business!" And he laughed again
forced and false.</p>

<p>Balsamo held his peace, reserving his powers for the storm
impending.</p>

<p>"How far has your business advanced?" he inquired, painfully
turning in his chair and fixing his large gray eyes on
the pupil.</p>

<p>"I have thrown the first stone," he replied, feeling the
glance go through him. "The pool is stirred up. The mud
is in agitation&mdash;the philosophic sediment."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are going to bring into play your utopias, fogs
and hollow dreams. These idiots dispute about the existence
or non-existence of the Almighty, when they might become
little gods themselves. Let us hear who are the famous philosophers
whom you have enlisted!"</p>

<p>"I have already the leading poet and the greatest atheist of
the age, who will be coming into France presently, to be
made a Freemason, in the lodge I am getting up in the old
Jesuits' College, Potaufer street. His name is Voltaire."</p>

<p>"I do not know him. The next?"</p>

<p>"I am to be introduced to the greatest sower of ideas of the
century, the author of the Social Contract, Rousseau."</p>

<p>"He is not known to me either."</p>

<p>"I expect not, as you only know such old alchemists as
Alfonso the Wise, Raymond Lully, Peter of Toledo and Albert
the Great."</p>

<p>"Because they are the only men who have really loved a
life, sowed ideas that live, and labored at the grand question
of to be or not to <a name="tn_png_187"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "be." on Page 185-->be."</p>

<p>"There are two ways of living, master."</p>

<p>"I only know of one&mdash;existing. But to return to your
brace of philosophers. With their help you intend to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grasp the present and sap the future."</p>

<p>"How stupid they must be in this country to be lured away
by ideas."</p>

<p>"No, it is because they have too much brains that they are
led by ideas. And then, I have a more powerful help than
all the philosophers&mdash;the fact that monarchy has lasted sixteen
hundred years in France, and the French are tired of
it."</p>

<p>"Hence, they are going to overturn the throne, and you
are backing them with all your forces! You fool! What<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>
good is the upsetting of this monarchy going to do
you?"</p>

<p>"It will bring me nothing, at the best, but it will be happiness
for others."</p>

<p>"Come, come, I am in a good humor <a name="tn_png_188"></a><!--TN: "to day" changed to "to-day" on Page 186-->to-day, and can
listen to your nonsense. Explain to me how you will obtain
the general weal and what it consists of."</p>

<p>"A ministry is in power which is the last rampart defending
the monarchy; it is a cabinet, brave, industrious and intelligent,
which might sustain this wornout and staggering monarchy
for yet twenty years. My aids will overturn it."</p>

<p>"Your philosophers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, for they are in favor of the ministry, for its head
is a philosopher too."</p>

<p>"Then they are a selfish pack. What great imbeciles!"</p>

<p>"I do not care to discuss what they are, for I do not know,"
said Balsamo, who was losing his patience. "I only know
that they will all cry down the next ministry when this one
is <a name="tn_png_188b"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "destroyed" on Page 186-->destroyed."</p>

<p>"This new cabinet will have against it the philosophers and
then the <a name="tn_png_188a"></a><!--TN: "Parliment" changed to "Parliament" on Page 186-->Parliament. They will make such an uproar that the
cabinet will persecute the philosophers and block the Parliament.
Then in mind and matter will be organized a sullen
league, a tenacious, stubborn, restless opposition, which will
attack everything, undermining and shaking. Instead
of Parliament they will try to rule with judges appointed by
the king; they will do everything for their appointer. With
reason they will be accused of venality, corruption and injustice.
The people will rise, and at last royalty will have
arrayed against it philosophy, which is intelligence, Parliament,
which is the middle class, and the mob, which is the
people; in other words, the lever with which Archimedes can
raise the world."</p>

<p>"Well, when you have lifted it, you will have to let it fall
again."</p>

<p>"Yes, but when it falls it will smash the royalty."</p>

<p>"To use your figurative language, when this wormeaten
monarchy is broken, what will come out of the ruins?"</p>

<p>"Freedom."</p>

<p>"The French be free? Well, then, there will be thirty millions
of freemen in France?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Among them do you not think there will be one with a
bigger brain than another, who will rob them of freedom some
fine morning that he may have a larger share than his proper
one for himself? Do you not remember a dog we had at Medina
which used to eat as much as all the rest together?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I remember that they all together pitched on him
one day and devoured him."</p>

<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>

<p>"Because they were dogs; men would have continued to
give in to the greediest."</p>

<p>"Do you set the instincts of animals above the intelligence
of man?"</p>

<p>"Forsooth, the examples abound by which to prove it. Among
the ancients was one Julius Cæsar, and among the moderns
one Oliver Cromwell, who ate up the Roman and the English
cake, without anybody snatching many crumbs away from
them."</p>

<p>"Well, supposing such an usurper comes, he must die some
day, being mortal, but before dying he must do good to even
those whom he oppressed; for he would have changed the
nature of the upper classes. Obliged to have some kind of support,
he will choose the popular as the strongest. To the
equality which abases, he will oppose the kind which elevates.
Equality has no fixed water mark, but takes the level of him
who makes it. In raising the lowest classes he will have hallowed
a principle unknown before his time. The Revolution
will have made the French free; the Protectorate of another
Cæsar or Cromwell will have made them equal."</p>

<p>"What a stupid fellow this is!" said Althotas, starting in
his chair. "To spend twenty years in bringing up a child so
that he shall came and tell you, who taught him all you
knew&mdash;'Men are equal.' Before the law, maybe; but before
death? how about that? One dies in three days&mdash;another lives a
hundred years! Men, equals before they have conquered
death? Oh, the brute, the triple brute!"</p>

<p>Althotas sat back to laugh more freely at Balsamo, who kept
his head lowered, gloomy and thoughtful. His instructor
took pity on him.</p>

<p>"Unhappy sophist that you are, bear in mind one thing,
that men will not be equals until they are immortal. Then
they will be gods, and these alone are undying."</p>

<p>"Immortal&mdash;what a dream!" sighed the mesmerist.</p>

<p>"Dream? so is the steam, the electric fluid, all that we are
hunting after and not yet caught&mdash;a dream. But we will seize
and they will be realities. Move with me the dust of ages,
and see that man in all times has been seeking what I
am engaged upon, under the different titles of the Bliss, the
Best, the Perfection. Had they found it, this decrepit world
would be fresh and rosy as the morning. Instead, see the dry
leaf, the corpse, the carrion heap! Is suffering desirable&mdash;the
corpse pleasant to look upon&mdash;the carrion sweet?"</p>

<p>"You yourself are saying that nobody has found this water
of life," observed Balsamo, as the old man was interrupted by
a dry cough. "I tell you that nobody will find it."</p>

<p>"By this rule there would be no discoveries. Do you think
discoveries are novelties which are invented? Not so&mdash;they
are forgotten things coming up anew. Why were the once-<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>found
things forgotten. Because the inventor's life was too
short for him to derive from it all its perfection. Twenty
times they have nearly consummated the water of life. Chiron
would have made Achilles completely immortal but for the lack
of the three drops of blood which you refuse me. In the flaw
death found a passage, and entered. I repeat that Chiron was
another Althotas prevented by an Acharat from completing
the work which would save all mankind by shielding it from
the divine malediction. Well, what have you to say to
that?"</p>

<p>"Merely," said Balsamo, visibly shaken, <a name="tn_png_190"></a><!--TN: Quote added before "that" on Page 188-->"that you have
your work and I mine. Let each accomplish his, at his risks
and perils. But I will not second yours by a crime."</p>

<p>"A crime? when I ask but three drops of blood&mdash;one child&mdash;and
you would deluge a country with billions of gallons!
Tell me now who is the cannibal of us two? Ha, ha! you do
not answer me."</p>

<p>"My answer is that three drops would be nothing if you
were sure of success."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, who would send millions to the scaffold
and battle-field? Can you stand up before the Creator and
say, 'O Master of Life, in return for four millions of slain
men, I will warrant the happiness of humanity.'"</p>

<p>"Master, ask for something else," said Balsamo, eluding the
point.</p>

<p>"Ha! you do not answer; you cannot answer," taunted Althotas
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken on the efficacy of the means. It is
impossible."</p>

<p>"It looks as if you argued with me, disputed, deem me a
liar," said the old alchemist, rolling with cold anger his gray
eyes under his white brows.</p>

<p>"No, but I am in contact with men and things, and you
dwell in a nook, in the pure abstraction of a student; I see the
difficulties and have to point them out."</p>

<p>"You would soon overcome such difficulties if you liked,
or believed."</p>

<p>"I do not believe."</p>

<p>"But do you believe that death is an incontestable thing,
invincible and infinite? And when you see a dead body,
does not the perspiration come to your brow, and a regret is
born in your breast?"</p>

<p>"No regret comes in to my breast because I have familiarized
myself to all human miseries; and I esteem life as a little
thing: but I say in presence of the corpse: 'Dead! thou who
wert mighty as a god! O Death! it is thou who reign sovereignly,
and nothing can prevail against thee.'"</p>

<p>Althotas listened in silence, with no other token of impatience
than fidgeting with a scalpel in his hands. When his<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>
disciple had finished the solemn and doleful phrase, he smiled
while looking round. His eyes, so burning that no secrets
seemed to exist for him, stopped on a nook in the room, where
a little dog trembled on a handful of straw. It was the last
of three of a kind, which Balsamo had provided on request of
the elder for his experiments.</p>

<p>"Bring that dog to this table," said he to Balsamo, who
laid the creature on a marble slab.</p>

<p>Seeming to foresee its doom and having probably already
been handled by the dissector, the animal shuddered, wriggled
and yelped at contact of the cold stone.</p>

<p>"So you believe in life, since you do in death?" squeaked
Althotas. "This dog looks live enough, eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, as it moves and whines."</p>

<p>"How ugly black dogs are! I should like white ones another
time. Howl away, you cur," said the vivisectionist
with his lugubrious laugh; "howl, to convince Grand Seignior
Acharat that you live."</p>

<p>He pierced the animal at a certain muscle so that he whimpered
instead of barking.</p>

<p>"Good! push the bell of the air pump hither. But stay, I
must ask what kind of death you prefer for him&mdash;deem best?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean; death is death, master."</p>

<p>"Very correct, what you say, and I agree with you. Since
one kind of death is the same as another, exhaust the air,
Acharat."</p>

<p>Balsamo worked the air pump, and the air in the bell of
glass hissed out at the bottom, so that the little puppy grew
uneasy at the first, looked around, began to sniff, put his paw
to the issue till the pain of the pressure made him take it away,
and then he fell suffocated, puffed up and asphyxiated.</p>

<p>"Behold the dog dead of apoplexy," pronounced the sage;
"this is a fine mode with no long suffering. But you do not
seem fully convinced. I suppose you know how well laden
I am with resources, and you think I have the method of restoring
the respiration."</p>

<p>"No, I am not supposing that. The dog is truly not
alive."</p>

<p>"Never mind, we will make assurance doubly sure by killing
the canine twice. Lift off the receiver, Acharat."</p>

<p>The glass bell was removed and there lay the victim, never
stirring, with eyes shut and heart without a <a name="tn_png_191"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "beat." on Page 189-->beat.</p>

<p>"Take the scalpel and sever the spinal column without cutting
the larynx."</p>

<p>"I do so solely because you say it."</p>

<p>"And to finish the poor creature in case it be not dead,"
said the other, with the smile of obstinacy peculiar to the
aged.</p>

<p>With one incision Balsamo separated the vertebral column<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>
a couple of inches from the brain, and opened a yawning
gash. The body remained unmoving.</p>

<p>"He is an inert animal, icy cold, forever without movement,
eh? You say nothing prevails against death? No
power can restore even the appearance of life, far less life
itself, to this carcass?"</p>

<p>"Only the miracle of Heaven!"</p>

<p>"But Heaven does not do such things. Supreme wisdom
kills because there is reason or benefit in the act. An assassin
said so, and he was quite right. Nature has an interest in
the death. Now, what will you say if this dog opens his eyes
and looks at you?"</p>

<p>"It would much astonish me," said the pupil smiling.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that it would do as much as that."</p>

<p>As he drew the dog up to an apparatus which we know as a
voltaic pile, he rounded off his words with his false and grating
laugh. The pile was composed of a vessel containing
strips of metal separated by felt. All were bathed in acidulated
water; out of the cup came the two ends of wire&mdash;the
poles to speak technically.</p>

<p>"Which eye shall it open, Acharat?" inquired the experimentalist.</p>

<p>"The right."</p>

<p>The two extremities were brought together, but parted by a
little silk, on a neck muscle. In an instant the dog's right eye
opened and stared at Balsamo, who could not help recoiling.</p>

<p>"Look out," said the infernal jester, with his dry laugh;
"our dead dog is going to bite you!"</p>

<p>Indeed, the animal, in spite of its sundered spine, with gaping
jaws and tremulous eye, suddenly got upon its four legs,
and tottered on them. With his hair bristling, Balsamo receded
to the door, uncertain whether to flee or remain.</p>

<p>"But we must not frighten you to death in trying to teach
you," said Althotas, pushing back the cadaver and the machine;
the contact broken, the carcass fell back into immovability.</p>

<p>"You see that we may arrive at the point I spoke of, my
son, and prolong life since we can annul death?"</p>

<p>"Not so, for you have only obtained a semblance of life,"
objected Balsamo.</p>

<p>"In time, we shall make it real. The Roman poets&mdash;and
they were esteemed prophets&mdash;assert that Cassidæus revived
the dead."</p>

<p>"But one objection: supposing your elixir perfect and a
dog given some, it would live on&mdash;until it fell into the hands of
a dissector who would cut its throat."</p>

<p>"I thought you would take me there," chuckled the old
wizard, clapping his hands.</p>

<p>"Your elixir will not prevent a chimney falling on a man,<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>
a bullet going clear through him, or a horse kicking his skull
open?"</p>

<p>Althotas eyed the speaker like a fencer watching his antagonist
make a lunge which lays him open to defeat.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, and you are a true logician. No, my dear
Acharat, such accidents cannot be avoided; the wounds will
still be made, but I can stop the vital spirit issuing by the
hole. Look!"</p>

<p>Before the other could interfere he drove the lancet into his
arm. The old man had so little blood that it was some time
flowing to the cut; but when it came it was abundantly.</p>

<p>"Great God! you have hurt yourself!" cried the younger
man.</p>

<p>"We must convince you."</p>

<p>Taking up a phial of colorless fluid, he poured a few
drops on the wound; instantly the liquid congealed, or rather
threw out fibres <a name="tn_png_193"></a><!--TN: "materializng" changed to "materializing" on Page 191-->materializing, and, soon a plaster of a yellow hue
covered in the gash and stanched the flow. Balsamo had
never seen collodion, and he gazed in stupefaction at the old
sage.</p>

<p>"You are the wisest of men, father!"</p>

<p>"At least if I have not dealt Death a death-blow, I have
given him a thrust under which he will find it hard to rise.
You see, my son, that the human frame has brittle bones&mdash;I
will harden and yet supple them like steel. It has blood
which, in flowing out, carries life with it&mdash;I will stop the flow.
The skin and flesh are soft&mdash;I will tan them so that they will
turn the edge of steel and blunt the points of spears, while
bullets will flatten against it. Only let an Althotas live three
hundred years. Well, give me what I want, and I shall live
a thousand. Oh, my dear Acharat, all depends on you.
Bring me the child."</p>

<p>"I will think it over, and do you likewise reflect."</p>

<p>The sage darted a look of withering scorn on his adept.</p>

<p>"Go!" he snarled, "I will convince you later. Besides,
human blood is not so precious that I cannot use a substitute.
Go, and let me seek&mdash;and I shall find. I have no need of you.
Begone!"</p>

<p>Balsamo walked over to the elevator, and with a stamp of
the foot, caused it to carry him down to the other floor. Mute,
crushed by the genius of this wizard, he was forced to believe
in impossible things by his doing them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a><br>

<span class="chapterhead">THE KING'S NEW AMOUR.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">This</span> same long night had been employed by Countess Dubarry
in trying to mold the king's mind to a new policy
according to her views.</p>

<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>

<p>Above all she had dwelt upon the necessity of not letting
the Choiseul party win possession of the dauphiness. The
king had answered carelessly that the princess was a girl and
Choiseul an old statesman, so that there was no danger, since
one only wanted to sport and the other to labor. Enchanted
at what he thought a witticism, he cut short further dry
talk.</p>

<p>But Jeanne did not stay stopped, for she fancied the royal
lover was thinking of another.</p>

<p>He was fickle. His great pleasure was in making his lady-loves
jealous, as long as they did not sulk too long or become
too riotous in their jealous fits.</p>

<p>Jeanne Dubarry was jealous naturally, and from fear of a
fall. Her position had cost her too much pains to conquer
and was too far from the starting-point for her to tolerate
rivals as Lady Pompadour had done.</p>

<p>Hence she wanted to know what was on the royal mind.</p>

<p>He answered by these memorable words, of which he did
not mean a jot:</p>

<p>"I intend to make my daughter-in-law very happy and I
am afraid that my son will not make her so."</p>

<p>"Why not, sire?"</p>

<p>"Because he looks at other women a good deal, and very
seldom at her."</p>

<p>"If any but your majesty said that, I should disbelieve
them, for the archduchess is sweetly pretty."</p>

<p>"She might be rounded out more; that Mademoiselle de
Taverney is the same age and she has a finer figure. She is
perfectly lovely."</p>

<p>Fire flashed in the favorite's eyes and warned the speaker
of his blunder.</p>

<p>"Why, I wager that you were plump as Watteau's <a name="tn_png_194"></a><!--TN: "shepherdessses" changed to "shepherdesses" on Page 192-->shepherdesses
at sixteen," said he quickly, which adulation improved
matters a little, but the mischief was done.</p>

<p>"Humph," said she, bridling up under the pleased smile,
"is the young lady of the Taverney family so very, very
fair?"</p>

<p>"I only noticed that she was not a bag of bones. You
know I am short-sighted and the general outline alone strikes
me. I saw that the new-comer from Austria was not plump,
that is all."</p>

<p>"Yes, you must only see generally, for the Austrian is a
stylish beauty, and the provincial lady a vulgar one."</p>

<p>"According to this, Jeanne, you would be the vulgar
kind," said the monarch. "You are joking, I think."</p>

<p>"That is a compliment, but it is wrapped up in a compliment
to another," thought the favorite, and aloud she said:
"Faith, I should like the dauphiness to choose a bevy of
beauties for maids of honor. A court of old tabbies is frightful."</p>

<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>

<p>"You are talking over one won to your side, for I was saying
the same thing to the dauphin; but he is indifferent."</p>

<p>"However, she begins well, you think, to take this Taverney
girl. She has no money?"</p>

<p>"No, but she has blood. The Taverney Redcastles are a
good old house and long-time servants of the realm."</p>

<p>"Who is backing them?"</p>

<p>"Not the Choiseuls, for they would be overfeasted with pensions
in that case."</p>

<p>"I beg you not to bring in politics, countess!"</p>

<p>"Is it bringing in politics to say the Choiseuls are blood-sucking
the realm?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." And he arose.</p>

<p>An hour after he regained the Grand Trianon palace, happy
at having inspired jealousy, though he said to himself, as a
Richelieu might do at thirty:</p>

<p>"What a bother these jealous women are!"</p>

<p>Dubarry went into her boudoir, where Chon was impatiently
waiting for the news.</p>

<p>"You are having fine success," she exclaimed; "day before
yesterday presented to the dauphiness, you dined at her table
yesterday."</p>

<p>"That's so&mdash;but much good in such nonsense."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, when a hundred fashionable carriages are
racing to bring you courtiers?"</p>

<p>"I am vexed, sorry for them, as they will not have any
smiles from me this morning. Let me have my chocolate."</p>

<p>"Stormy weather, eh?"</p>

<p>Chon rang and Zamore came in to get the order. He started
off so slowly, and humping up his back, that the mistress
cried:</p>

<p>"Is that slowcoach going to make me perish of hunger? If
he plays the camel and does not hurry, he'll get a hundred
lashes on his back."</p>

<p>"Me no hurry&mdash;me gubbernor," replied the black boy, majestically.</p>

<p>"You a governor?" screamed the lady, flourishing a fancy
riding whip kept to maintain order among the spaniels. "I'll
give you a lesson in governing."</p>

<p>But the negro ran out yelling.</p>

<p>"You are quite ferocious, Jeanne," remarked her sister.</p>

<p>"Surely I have the right to be ferocious in my own
house?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but I am going to elope, for fear I may be devoured
alive."</p>

<p>Three knocks on the door came to interrupt the outbreak.</p>

<p>"Hang it all&mdash;who is bothering now?" cried the countess,
stamping her foot.</p>

<p>"He is in for a nice welcome," muttered Chon.</p>

<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>

<p>"It will be a good thing if I am badly received," said Jean,
as he pushed open the door as widely as though he were a
king, "for then I should take myself off and not come again.
And you would be the greater loser of the two."</p>

<p>"Saucebox&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because I am not a flatterer. What is the matter with the
girl this morning, Chon?"</p>

<p>"She is not safe to go near."</p>

<p>"Oh, here comes the chocolate! Good-morning, Chocolate,"
said the favorite's brother, taking the platter and
putting it on a small table, at which he seated himself. "Come
and tuck it in, Chon! those who are too proud won't get any,
that's all."</p>

<p>"You are a nice pair," said Jeanne, "gobbling up the bread
and butter instead of wondering what worries me."</p>

<p>"Out of cash, I suppose?" said Chon.</p>

<p>"Pooh, the king will run out before I do."</p>

<p>"Then lend me a thousand&mdash;I can do with it," said the man.</p>

<p>"You will get a thousand <i>fillips</i> on the nose sooner than a
thousand <i>Louis</i>."</p>

<p>"Is the king going to keep that abominable Choiseul?"
questioned Chon.</p>

<p>"That is no novelty&mdash;you know that they are sticks-in-the-mud."</p>

<p>"Has the old boy fallen in love with the dauphiness?"</p>

<p>"You are getting warm; but look at the glutton, ready to
burst with swilling chocolate and will not lift a finger to help
me out of my quandary."</p>

<p>"You never mean to say the king has another fancy?"
cried Chon, clasping her hands, and turning pale.</p>

<p>"If I did not say so your brother would, for he will either
choke with the chocolate or get it out."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Jean managed to gasp the name:</p>

<p>"Andrea of Taverney!"</p>

<p>"The baron's daughter&mdash;oh, mercy!" groaned Chon.</p>

<p>"I do not know what keeps me from tearing his eyes out, the
lazybones, to go puffing them up with sleep when our fortunes
stagger."</p>

<p>"With want of sleep you mean," returned Jean. "I am
sleepy, as I am hungry, for the same reason&mdash;I have been running
about the streets all night."</p>

<p>"Just like you."</p>

<p>"And all the morning."</p>

<p>"You might have run to some purpose, and found out
where that intriguing jade is housed."</p>

<p>"The very thing&mdash;I questioned the driver of the carriage
lent to them, and he took them to Coq Heron street. They are
living in a little house at the back, next door to Armenonville
House."</p>

<p>"Jean, Jean, we are good friends again," said the countess.
"Gorge as you like. But we must have all the particulars
about her, how she lives, who calls on her, and what she is
about. Does she get any love letters&mdash;these are important to
know."</p>

<p>"I have got us started on the right road anyway," said
Jean; "suppose you do a little now."</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_197"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "Well," on Page 195-->"Well," suggested Chon, "there must be rooms to let in
that street."</p>

<p>"Excellent idea," said the countess. "You must be off
quickly to the place, Jean, and hire a flat there, where a
watcher can mark down all her doings."</p>

<p>"No use; there are no rooms to hire there; I inquired; but
I can get what we want in the street at the back, overlooking
their place, Plastrière Street."</p>

<p>"Well, quick! get a room there."</p>

<p>"I have done that," answered Jean.</p>

<p>"Admirable fellow&mdash;come, let me buss thee!" exclaimed
the royal <a name="tn_png_197b"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "favorite." on Page 195-->favorite.</p>

<p>Jean wiped his mouth, received the caress and made a
ceremonious bow to show that he was duly grateful for the
honor.</p>

<p>"I took the little suite for a young widow. Young widow,
you, Chon."</p>

<p>"Capital! it shall be Chon who will take the lodgings and
keep an eye on what goes on. But you must not lose any
time. The coach," cried Dubarry, ringing the bell so loudly
that she would have roused all the spellbound servants of the
palace of the Sleeping Beauty.</p>

<p>The three knew how highly to rate Andrea, for at her first
sight she had excited the king's attention; hence she was dangerous.</p>

<p>"This girl," said the countess while the carriage was being
got ready; "cannot be a true country wench if she has not
made some sweetheart follow her to Paris. Let us hunt up this
chap and get her married to him offhand. Nothing would
so <a name="tn_png_197a"></a><!--TN: Illegible word replaced by "****" on Page 195-->**** off the king as rustic lovers getting wedded."</p>

<p>"I do not know so much about that," said Jean. "Let us
be distrustful. His most Christian majesty is greedy for what
is another's property."</p>

<p>Chon departed in the coach, with Jean's promise that he
would be her first visitor in the new lodgings. She was in
luck, for she had hardly more than taken possession of the
rooms, and gone to look out of the window commanding a
view of the rear gardens than a young lady came to sit at the
summer-house window, with embroidery in her hand.</p>

<p>It was Andrea.</p>

<span class="chapterhead">TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Chon</span> had not been many minutes scanning the Taverney
lady, when Viscount Jean, racing up the stairs four at a time
like a schoolboy, appeared on the threshold of the pretended
widow's room.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, Jean, I am placed splendidly to see what goes on,
but I am unfortunate about hearing."</p>

<p>"You ask too much. Oh, I say, I have a bit of news,
marvelous and incomparable. Those philosophic fellows say
a wise man ought to be ready for anything, but I cannot be
wise, for this knocked me. I give you a hundred chances to
guess who I ran up against at a public fountain at the corner; he
was sopping a piece of bread in the gush, and it was&mdash;our
philosopher."</p>

<p>"Who? Gilbert?"</p>

<p>"The very boy, with bare head, open waistcoat, stockings
ungartered, shoes without buckles, in short, just as he turned
out of bed."</p>

<p>"Then he lives by here? Did you speak to him?"</p>

<p>"We recognized one another, and when I thrust out my
hand, he bolted like a harrier among the crowd, so that I lost
sight of him. You don't think I was going to run after him,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Hardly, but then you have lost him."</p>

<p>"What a pity!" said the girl Sylvie, whom Chon had
brought along as her maid.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said Jean; "I owe him a hundred stripes
with a whip, and they would not have spoilt by keeping any
longer had I got a grip of his collar; but he guessed my good
intentions and fled. No matter, here he is in town; and when
one has the ear of the chief of police, anybody can be found."</p>

<p>"Shut him up when you catch him," said Sylvie, "but in
a safe place."</p>

<p>"And make you turnkey over him," suggested Jean, winking.
"She would like to take him his bread and water."</p>

<p>"Stop your joking, brother," said Chon; "the young fellow
saw your row over the post-horses, and he is to be feared
if you set him against you."</p>

<p>"How can he live without means?"</p>

<p>"Tut, he will hold horses or run errands."</p>

<p>"Never mind him; come to our observatory."</p>

<p>Brother and sister approached the window with infinity of
precautions. Jean had provided himself with a telescope.</p>

<p>Andrea had dropped her needlework, put up her feet on a
lower chair, taken a book, and was reading it with some
attention, for she remained very still.</p>

<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>

<p>"Fie on the studious person!" sneered Chon.</p>

<p>"What an admirable one!" added Jean. "A perfect being&mdash;what
arms, what hands! what eyes! lips that would wreck
the soul of St. Anthony&mdash;oh, the divine feet&mdash;and what
an ankle in that silk hose?"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue! this is coming on finely," said Chon.
"You are smitten with her, now. This is the drop that fills
the bucket."</p>

<p>"It would not be a bad job if it were so, and she returned
me the flame a little. It would save our poor sister a lot of
worry."</p>

<p>"Let me have the spyglass a while. Yes, she is very
handsome, and she must have had a sweetheart out there in
the woods. But she is not reading&mdash;see, the book slips out of
her hand. I tell you, Jean, that she is in a brown study."</p>

<p>"She sleeps, you mean."</p>

<p>"Not with her eyes open&mdash;what lovely eyes! This a good
glass, Jean&mdash;I can almost read in her book."</p>

<p>"What is the book, then?"</p>

<p>Chon was leaning out a little when she suddenly drew
back.</p>

<p>"Gracious! look at that head sticking out of the garret
window&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gilbert, by Jove! with what burning eyes he is glaring on
the Taverney girl!"</p>

<p>"I have it: he is the country gallant of his lady. He has
had the notice where she was coming to live in Paris and he
has taken a room close to her. A change of dovecote for the
turtle-doves."</p>

<p>"Sister, we need not trouble now, for he will do all the
watching&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For his own gain."</p>

<p>"No, for ours. Let me pass, as I must go and see the chief
of police. By Jupiter, what luck we have! But don't you

<p><span class="firstwords">Sartines</span> had allowed himself to sleep late, as he had managed
the multitude very well during the dauphiness' reception,
and he was trying on new wigs at noon as a kind of holiday
when Chevalier Jean Dubarry was announced.</p>

<p>The minister of police was sure that nothing unpleasant
had occurred, as the favorite's brother was smiling.</p>

<p>"What brings you so early?"</p>

<p>"To begin with," replied Jean, always ready to flatter those
of whom he wanted to make use, "I am bound to compliment<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>
you on the admirable way in which you regulated the processions."</p>

<p>"Is this official?"</p>

<p>"Quite, so far as Luciennes is <a name="tn_png_200"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "concerned."-->concerned."</p>

<p>"Is not that ample&mdash;does not the Sun rise in that quarter?"</p>

<p>"It goes down there very often, eh?" and the pair laughed.
"But, the compliments apart, I have a service to ask of you."</p>

<p>"Two, if you like."</p>

<p>"Tell me if anything lost in Paris can be found?"</p>

<p>"Yes, whether worthless or very valuable."</p>

<p>"My object of search is not worth much," responded Jean,
shaking his head. "Only a young fellow of eighteen, named
Gilbert, who was in the service of the Taverneys in Lorraine,
but was picked up on the road by my sister Chon. She took
him to Luciennes, where he abused the hospitality."</p>

<p>"Stole something?"</p>

<p>"I do not say so, but he took flight in a suspicious manner."</p>

<p>"Have you any clue to his hiding place?"</p>

<p>"I met him at the fountain at the corner of Plastrière
Street, where I suppose he is living, and I believe I could lay
my hand on the very house."</p>

<p>"All right, I will send a sure agent, who will take him out
of it!"</p>

<p>"The fact is, this is a special affair, and I should like you
to manage it without a third party."</p>

<p>"Oh, in that case, let me pick out a becoming wig and I am
with you."</p>

<p>"I have a carriage below."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I prefer my own; it gets a new coat of paint
every month, so as not to betray me."</p>

<p>He had tried on his twentieth peruke when the carriage
was waiting at the door.</p>

<p>"There it is, the dirty house," said Jean, pointing in the
direction of a dwelling in Plastrière street.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Sartines, "dash me if I did not suspect this.
You are unlucky, for that is the dwelling of Rousseau, of
Geneva."</p>

<p>"The scribbler? What does that matter?"</p>

<p>"It matters that Rousseau is a man to be dreaded."</p>

<p>"Pooh! it is not likely my little man will be harbored by a
celebrity."</p>

<p>"Why not, as you nicknamed him a philosopher? Birds of
a feather&mdash;you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suppose it is so. Why not put this Rousseau in the Bastille
if he is in our way?"</p>

<p>"Well, he would be more in our way there than here. You
see the mob likes to throw stones at him, but they would pelt
us if he was no longer their target, and they want him for
themselves. But let us see into this. Sit back in the carriage."</p>

<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>

<p>He referred to a notebook.</p>

<p>"I have it. If your young blade is with Rousseau, when
would he have met him?"</p>

<p>"Say, on the sixteenth instant."</p>

<p>"Good! he returned from botanizing in Meudon Wood on
the seventeenth with a youth, and this stranger stayed all night
under his roof. You are crossed by luck. Give it up or you
would have all the philosophers against us in riot."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! what will sister Jeanne say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, does the countess want the lad? Why not coax him
out, and then we would nab him, anywhere not inside Rousseau's
house?"</p>

<p>"You might as well coax a hyena."</p>

<p>"I doubt it is so difficult. All you want is a go-between.
Let me see; a prince will not do; better one of these writers,
a poet, a philosopher or a bota&mdash;stay, I have him!"</p>

<p>"Gilbert?"</p>

<p>"Yes, through a botanist friend of Rousseau's. You know
Jussieu?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for the countess lets him prowl in her gardens and
rifle them."</p>

<p>"I begin to believe that you shall have your Gilbert, without
any noise. Rousseau will hand him over, pinioned, so to
say. So you go on making a trap for philosophers, according
to a plan I will give you, on vacant ground out Meudon or
Marly way. Now, let us be off, as the passengers are beginning
to stare at us. Home, coachman!"</p>

<span class="chapterhead">TOO GOOD A TEACHER.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">Fatigued</span> by the ceremonies of the dauphin's nuptials, and
particularly by the dinner, which was too stately, the king retired
at nine o'clock and dismissed all attendants except Duke
Vauguyon, tutor of the royal children. As he was losing his best
pupil by the marriage, having only his two brothers to teach,
and as it is the custom to reward a preceptor when education
of a charge is complete, he expected a recompense.</p>

<p>He had been sobbing, and now he slipped out a pockethandkerchief
and began to weep.</p>

<p>"Come, my poor Vauguyon," said the king, pointing to
a foot-stool in the light, while he would be in the shade,
"pray be seated, without any to-do."</p>

<p>The duke sighed.</p>

<p>"The education is over, and you have turned out in the
prince royal the best educated prince in Europe."</p>

<p>"I believe he is."</p>

<p>"Good at history, and geography, and at wood-turning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The praise for that goes to another, sire."</p>

<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>

<p>"And at setting timepieces in order. Before he handled
them, my clocks told the time one after another like wheels of
a coach; but he has put them right. In short, the heir to the
crown will, I believe, be a good king, a good manager, and a
good father of family. I suppose he will be a good father?"
he insisted.</p>

<p>"Why, your majesty," said Vauguyon simply, "I consider
that as the dauphin has all the germs of good in his bosom,
those that constitute that are in the cluster."</p>

<p>"Come, come, my lord," said the sovereign, "let us speak
plainly. As you know the dauphin thoroughly, you must
know all about his tastes and his passions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sire, but I have extirpated all his passions."</p>

<p>"Confound it all! this is just what I feared!" exclaimed
Louis XV., with an energy which made the hearer's wig
stand its hairs on end.</p>

<p>"Sire, the Duke of Berri has lived under your august roof
with the innocence of the studious youth."</p>

<p>"But the youth is now a married man."</p>

<p>"Sire, as the guide of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, well, I see that you must guide him to the very last."</p>

<p>"Please your majesty."</p>

<p>"This is the way of it. You will go to the dauphin, who
is now receiving the final compliments of the gentlemen as
the dauphiness is receiving those of the ladies. Get a candle
and take your pupil aside. Show him the nuptial chamber
which is at the end of a corridor filled with pictures which I
have selected as a complete course of the instruction which
your lordship omitted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the duke, starting at the smile of his master,
which would have appeared cynical on any mouth but his,
the wittiest in the kingdom.</p>

<p>"At the end of the new corridor, I say, of which here is
the key."</p>

<p>Vauguyon took it trembling.</p>

<p>"You will shake your pupil's hand, put the candle into it,
wish him good-night, and tell him that it will take twenty
minutes to reach the bedroom door, giving a minute to each
painting."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I understand."</p>

<p>"That is a good thing."</p>

<p>"Your majesty is good enough to excuse me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have to, but you were making this end
prettily for my family!"</p>

<p>From the window the king could see the candle which
passed from the hands of Vauguyon into that of his guileless
pupil, go the way up the new gallery, and flicker out.</p>

<p>"I gave him twenty minutes&mdash;I myself found five long
enough," muttered the king, "Alas, will they say of the<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>
dauphin as of the second Racine: 'He is the nephew of his
grandfather.'"</p>

<span class="chapterhead">A TERRIBLE WEDDING-NIGHT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> dauphin opened the door of the anteroom before the
wedding chamber.</p>

<p>The archduchess was waiting, in a long white wrapper,
with the strange anticipation on her brow, along with the
sweet expectation of the bride, of some disaster. She seemed
menaced with one of those terrors which nervous dispositions
foresee and support sometimes with more bravery than if not
awaited.</p>

<p>Lady Noailles was seated by the gilded couch, which easily
held the princess' frail and dainty body.</p>

<p>The maids of honor stood at the back, waiting for the mistress
of the attendants to make them the sign to withdraw.
These were all ignorant that the dauphin was coming by a
new way in. As the corridor was empty and the door at the
end ajar, he could see and hear what went on in the room.</p>

<p>"In what direction does my lord the dauphin come?"
inquired the Austrian's pure and harmonious voice though
slightly tremulous.</p>

<p>"Yonder," replied Lady Noailles, pointing just the wrong
way.</p>

<p>"What is that noise outside&mdash;not unlike the roaring
of angry waters?"</p>

<p>"It is the tumult of the innumerable sight-seers walking
about under the illumination and waiting for the fireworks
<a name="tn_png_203"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "display." on Page 201-->display."</p>

<p>"The illuminations?" said the princess with a sad smile.
"They must have been timely this evening, for did you not
notice it was very black weather?"</p>

<p>At this moment the dauphin, who was tired of waiting,
thrust his head in at the door, and asked if he might enter.
Lady Noailles screamed, for she did not recognize the intruder
at first. The dauphiness, worked up into a nervous state by
the incidents of the day, seized the duchess' arm in her
fright.</p>

<p>"It is I, madame; have no fear," called out the prince.</p>

<p>"But why by that way?" said Lady Noailles.</p>

<p>"Because," explained Louis the King, showing his head at
the half-open door, "because the Duke of Vauguyon knows
so much Latin, mathematics and geography as to leave room
for nothing else."</p>

<p>In presence of the king so untimely arrived, the dauphiness
slipped off the couch and stood up in the wrapper, clothed
from head to foot like a vestal virgin in her stole.</p>

<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>

<p>"Any one can see that she is thin," muttered the king;
"what the deuse made Choiseul pick out the skinny chicken
among all the pullets of European courts?"</p>

<p>"Your majesty will please to observe that I acted according
to the strict etiquette," said the Duchess of Noailles, "the infraction
was on my lord the dauphin's part."</p>

<p>"I take it on myself. So, let us leave the children to themselves,"
said the monarch.</p>

<p>The princess seized the lady's arm with more terror than
before.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't go away!" she faltered; "I shall die of shame."</p>

<p>"Sire, the dauphiness begs to be allowed to go to rest without
any state," said Lady Noailles.</p>

<p>"The deuce&mdash;and does 'Lady Etiquette' herself crave that?"</p>

<p>"Look at the archduchess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In fact, Marie Antoinette, standing up, pale and with her
rigid arm sustaining her by a chair, resembled a statue of
fright, but for the slight chattering of her teeth, and the cold
perspiration bedewing her forehead.</p>

<p>"Oh, I should not think of causing the young lady any
pain," said Louis XV., as little strict about forms as his father
was the other thing. "Let us retire, duchess; besides, the
doors have locks."</p>

<p>The dauphin blushed to hear these words of his grandfather,
but the lady, though hearing, had not understood.</p>

<p>King Louis XV. embraced his grand-daughter-in-law, and
went forth, with Lady Noailles, laughing mockingly and
sadly, for those who did not share his merriment.</p>

<p>The other persons had gone out by the other door.</p>

<p>The wedded pair were left alone in silence.</p>

<p>At last the young husband approached his bride with bosom
beating rapidly; to his temples, breast and wrist he felt all his
repressed blood rushing hotly. But he guessed that his grandfather
was behind the door, and the cynical glance still chilled
the dauphin, very timid and awkward by nature.</p>

<p>"You are not well, madame," he stammered. "You are
very pale, and I think you are trembling."</p>

<p>"I cannot conceal that I am under a spell of agitation;
there must be some terrible storm overhead, for I am peculiarly
affected by thunderstorms."</p>

<p>Indeed, she shook by spasms as though affected by electrical
shocks.</p>

<p>At this time, as though to justify her assertion, a furious gust
of wind, such as shear the tops off mountains and heap up half
the sea against the other&mdash;the first whoop of the coming tempest
filled the palace with tumult, anguish and many a creaking.
Leaves were swept off the branches, branches off the boughs
and from the trees. A long and immense clamor was drawn
from the hundred thousand spectators in the gardens. A<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>
lugubrious and endless bellowing ran through the corridors
and galleries, composing the most awful notes that had ever
vibrated in human ears.</p>

<p>Then an ominous rattling and jingling succeeded the roar;
it was the fall of countless shivers of glass out of the window
panes on the marble slabs and cornices.</p>

<p>At the same time the gale had opened one of the shutters
and banged it to and fro like a wings of a bird of night.
Wherever the window had been open and where the glass
was shivered the lights were put out.</p>

<p>The prince went over to the window to fasten the broken
shutter, but his wife held him back.</p>

<p>"Oh, pray, do not open that window, for the lights will be
blown out, and I should die of fright."</p>

<p>He stopped. Through the casement beyond the curtain
which he had drawn the tree tops of the park were visible,
swayed from side to side as if some unseen giant were waving
them by the stems. All the illuminations were extinguished.</p>

<p>Then could be seen on the dark sky still blacker clouds,
coming on with a rolling motion like troops of cavalry
wrapped in dust.</p>

<p>The pallid prince stood with one hand on the sash-handle.
The bride sank on a chair, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"You are very much alarmed, madame?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though your presence supports me. Oh, what a
storm! all the pretty lights are put out."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a southwest wind, always the worst for storms.
If it holds out, I do not know how they will be able to set off
the fireworks."</p>

<p>"What would be the use of them? Everybody will be out of
the gardens in such weather."</p>

<p>"You do not know what our French are when there is a
show. They cry for the pyrotechnics, and this is to be
superb; the pyrotechnist showed me the sketches. There!
look at the first rockets!"</p>

<p>Indeed, brilliant as long fiery serpents, the trial rockets
rushed up into the clouds, but at the same time, as if the
storm had taken the flash as a challenge, one stroke of lightning,
seeming to split the sky, snaked among the rockets
ascending and eclipsed their red glare with its bluish flaring.</p>

<p>"Verily, it is impiety for man to contest with God," said
the archduchess.</p>

<p>The trial rockets had preceded the general display by but a
few minutes as the pyrotechnist felt the need of hastening,
and the first set pieces were fired and were hailed with a cheer
of delight.</p>

<p>But as though there were really a war between man and
heaven, the storm, irritated by the impiety, drowned with its
thunder the cheers of the mobs, and all the cataracts on high<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>
opened at once. Torrents of rain were precipitated from the
cloudy heights.</p>

<p>In like manner to the wind putting out the illuminations,
the rain put out the fireworks.</p>

<p>"What a misfortune, the fireworks are spoilt," said the
dauphin.</p>

<p>"Alas, everything goes wrong since I entered France," said
Marie Antoinette. "This storm suits the feast that was given
me. It was wanted to hide from the people the miseries
of this dilapidated palace of Versailles. So, blow, you southwest
wind! spout, rain! pile yourselves together, tempestuous
clouds, to hide from my eyes the paltry, tawdry reception
given to the daughter of the kaisers, when she laid her hand
in that of the future king!"</p>

<p>The visibly embarrassed dauphin did not know what answer
to make to this, these reproaches, and particularly this exalted
melancholy, so far from his character; he only sighed.</p>

<p>"I afflict you," continued she; "but do not believe that my
pride is speaking. No, no, it is nowise in it. Would that
they had only shown me the pretty little Trianon, with its
flower gardens, and smiling shades&mdash;the rain will but refresh
it, the wind but open the blossoms. That charming nest would
content me; but these ruins frighten me, so repugnant to my
youth, and yet how many more ruins will be created by this
frightful <a name="tn_png_206"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "storm." on Page 204-->storm."</p>

<p>A fresh gust, worse than the first, shook the palace. The
princess started up aghast.</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, tell me that there is no danger!" she moaned;
"I shall die of fright."</p>

<p>"There is no fear, madame. Versailles is built on terraces
so as to defy the storm. If lightning fell it would only strike
yonder chapel with its sharp roof, or the little tower which
has turrets. You know that peaks attract the electric fluid
and flat surfaces repel them."</p>

<p>He took her frozen yet palpitating hand.</p>

<p>Just then a vivid flash inundated the room with its
violet and livid glare. She uttered a scream and repulsed
her husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, you looked in the lurid gleam like a phantom, pale,
headless and bleeding!"</p>

<p>"It is the mirage caused by the sulphur," said the <a name="tn_png_206a"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "prince" on Page 204-->prince.
"I will explain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But a deafening peal of thunder cut short the sentence of
the phlegmatic prince lecturing the royal spouse.</p>

<p>"Come, come, madame, let us leave such fears to the common
people. Physical agitation is one of the conditions of
nature. A storm, and this is no more, is one of the most
frequent and natural phenomena. I do not know why people
are surprised at them."</p>

<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>

<p>"I should not quail so much at another time; but for a
storm to burst on our wedding-night, another awful forwarning
joined to those heralding my entry into France! My
mother has told me that this century is fraught with horrors,
as the heavens above are charged with fire and destruction."</p>

<p>"Madame, no dangers can menace the throne to which we
shall ascend, for we royalties dwell above the common
plane. The thunder is at our feet and we wield the bolts."</p>

<p>"Alas, something dreadful was predicted me, or rather,
shown to me in a dish of water. It is hard to describe what
was utterly novel to me; a machine reared on high like a
scaffold, two upright beams between which glided an axe of
odd shape. I saw my head beneath this blade. It descended
and my head, severed from the body, leaped to the earth.
This is what I was shown."</p>

<p>"Pure hallucination," said the scoffer; "there is no such
an instrument in existence, so be encouraged."</p>

<p>"Alas! I cannot drive away the odious thought."</p>

<p>"You will succeed, Marie," said the dauphin, drawing
nearer.</p>

<p>"Beside you will be an affectionate and assiduously protective
husband."</p>

<p>At the instant when the husband's lips nearly touched the
wife's cheek, the picture gallery door opened again, and the
curious, covetous look of King Louis XV. penetrated the
place. But simultaneously a crash, of which no words can
give an idea, resounded through the palace. A spout of white
flame, streaked with green, dashed past the widow but shivered
a statue on the balcony; then after a prodigious ripping
and splitting sound, it bounded upward and vanished like a
meteor.</p>

<p>Out went the candles! the dauphin staggered back, dazed
and frightened to the very wall. The dauphiness fell, half
swooned, on the step of her praying-desk and dwelt in deadly
torpor.</p>

<p>Believing the earth was quaking under him, Louis XV. regained
his rooms, followed by his faithful valet.</p>

<p>In the morning Versailles was not recognizable. The
ground had drunk up the deluge, and the trees absorbed the
sulphur.</p>

<p>Everywhere was mud and the broken boughs dragging
their blackened lengths like scotched serpents.</p>

<p>Louis XV. went to the bridal chamber for the third time,
and looked in. He shuddered to see at the praying-stand the
bride, pale and prone, with the aurora tinging her spotless
robe, like a Magdalen of Rubens.</p>

<p>On a chair, with his velvet slippers in a puddle of water,
the dauphin of France sat as pale as his wife and with the
same air of having faced a nightmare.</p>

<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>

<p>The nuptial bed was untouched.</p>

<p>Louis XV. frowned; a never-before-experienced pain ran
through his brow, cooled by egotism even when debauchery
tried to heat it.</p>

<p>He shook his head, sighed and returned to his apartments
full of grim forebodings over the future which this tragic
event had marked on its brow.</p>

<p>What dread and mysterious incidents were enfolded in its
bosom it will be our mission to disclose in the sequel to this
book, entitled "<span class="smcap">The Mesmerist's Victim</span>."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How to Get Married Although a Woman," by a
young widow, comes from the J. S. Ogilvie Publishing
Co., 57 Rose Street, New York. The woman anxious to
get married, but unable to do so, will find an immense
amount of advice and assistance in this little volume,
and will learn what manner of woman is liked and what
disliked by men, the reasons of success and failure in the
race matrimonial, some unfailing methods of catching
a husband, why it is that a plain widow can come into a
community and take her pick among the most eligible
men, and finally, how to retain the love of a husband
when he has been captured and how to get another one
when he has been gathered to his fathers. Any woman
who cannot catch a husband by the rules laid down in
this book does not deserve one, and it costs only 25
cents for all this valuable advice and information.</p></blockquote>

<p>"I was troubled
a long time with
sick headache. It
was usually accompanied
with severe pains in
the temples, a bad taste in my mouth, tongue coated,
hands and feet cold, and sickness at the stomach. I
tried many remedies, but until I began taking Ayer's
Pills received no benefit. A box of these pills did the
work for me, and I am now free from headaches and
am a well man."&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. H. Hutchings</span>, E. Auburn, Me.</p>
